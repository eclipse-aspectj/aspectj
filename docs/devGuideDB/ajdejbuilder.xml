		<title>Installation and Project Setup</title>
		<para>
        <command>Install procedure:</command> use the installer to place the
        "ajdeForJBuilder.jar" and "aspectjrt.jar" into JBuilder's lib/ext
        directory.  This will also install the two html files
        "LICENCE-AJDEJBUILDER.html" and "README-AJDEJBUILDER.html".
    </para>
		<para>
        <command>Uninstall procedure:</command> remove "ajdeForJBuilder.jar"
        and "aspectjrt.jar" (and the two html files, if you like) from the
        "lib/ext" directory.
    </para>
		<para>
        <command>Project setup:</command> follow the normal procedure for
        JBuilder project setup (for an example of this please refer to the
        example below).  However, note that all of the source files to be
        passed to the compiler must be added to your project either as files or
        within a package that is added to the project.  This is necessary
        because -- unlike a pure Java compiler -- ajc does not search the
        SOURCEPATH for classes.
    </para>

		<para>
        <command>Starting and stopping AJDE:</command> select "Start AJDE" in
        the "AspectJ" section of the "Tools" menu, or just click on the "AJDE"
        (<inlinemediaobject id="ajdebutton">
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata fileref="startAjde.gif" />
				</imageobject>
			</inlinemediaobject>) button (label 1 in the first screenshot).  This
        will enable AJDE commands and will replace JBuilder's structure view
        with the AspectJ Browser.  To disable AJDE select "Stop AJDE" in the
        same menu, or click the "AJDE" button again.

		<title>Compiling and Running the Project</title>
		<para>
        To compile the project select "Build project with ajc" from the AspectJ
        toolbar, or click &lt;ctrl&gt;F11 while the editor pane is active.  All
        of the files contained in your project and within any packages and
        subpackages that have been added to your project will be compiled.  You
        may also select a different configuration (as with label 2 in the first
        screenshot).  Then, structure of the currently visited file is shown
        (see label 3 in the first scrrenshot).  If there is a compile error,
        the clickable error message is available (as with label 4 in the first
        screenshot).
    </para>
		<para>
        To run the project select "Run Project" from the AspectJ toolbar, or
        click &lt;ctrl&gt;F12 while the editor pane is active.  Note that the
        "AspectJ Runtime" library must be added to your project in order to 
        run.  If the library is not added you will see a         "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/aspectj/lang/Signature" error.		The library is created automatically for you from the runtime
		in "jbuilderdir/lib/ext".  You can also create a new  library
		to use the runtime from a different location. If you have not added the 
		library to the "Required Libraries" of your project it will be added
		automatically when you restart JBuilder.
    </para>
		<para>
	JBuilder7 users please note: when you set up a run/debug configuration 
	you must select the "Build Target" (at the bottom of the 
	"Runtime Properties" dialog) to be "&lt;None&gt;".  This will ensure 
	that the Java compiler is not invoked on your AspectJ sources 
	before running or debugging the project.

		<title>Navigating the Program Structure</title>
		<imageobject>
			<imagedata fileref="jbuilder-structureNavigation.gif" />
		</imageobject>
		<para>
        Navigation of program structure is provided by the <xref linkend="ajbrowser">AspectJ Browser</xref>, so apart from a JBuilder
        look and feel, the extra navigation AspectJ allows work as described
        there.  In particular, you can use views with labels 1, 2 and 4 of the
        second screenshot to navigate structure using the blue links, and you
        can set filtering and navigate history using the toolbar shown by label
        3 of the second screenshot.
    </para>

		<title>Manipulating Build Configurations</title>
		<para>
            Build configurations can be manipulated adding, removing, and
            editing build configuration files.  The <xref linkend="ajbrowser">AspectJ Browser</xref> is used to select the
            current build configuration.  Configurations are represented by
            ".lst" files which are described in the <xref linkend="ajc">ajc</xref> documentation.
        </para>

			<title>Adding and Removing Build Configurations</title>
			<para>
                By default all of the files contained in your project and
                within any packages and subpackages that have been added to
                your project will be compiled.  In order to compile a different
                configuration first add it to the project (by selecting
                "Add Files / Packages..." in the "Project"
                menu, and selecting the desired build configuration file (see
                label 1 in the third screenshot).

			<title>Editing Build Configurations</title>
			<para>
                Double click a build configuration file in JBuilder's
                "Project Pane" in order to edit it.  Configurations
                can be edited as either text or in the graphical designer (see
                labels 2 and 3 in the third screenshot)
