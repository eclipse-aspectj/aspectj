AspectJ Development Environment (AJDE) support for Forte

Module extension to Sun's

Forte for Java

and

NetBeans

IDEs.

== Overview

For release-specific documentation refer to the
http://aspectj.org/doc/dist/changes.html[changes file].

AJDE for Forte will allow you to:

* compile AspectJ and Java files within the IDE
* browse the structure of your AspectJ program
* set up a compile configuration that determine which files will be
passed to the compiler

== Installation

* use the installer to place the "ajdeForForte.jar" and "aspectjrt.jar"
into the modules directory. This will also install the two html files
"LICENCE-AJDEFORTE.html" and "README-AJDEFORTE.html".
* start up, and in the "Tools" menu select "Global Options"
* right-click the "Modules" item and select "New Module from File..."
* find the ajdeForForte.jar in the directory that you installed into
(e.g. c:/forte4j/modules) and select it

To uninstall follow Forte's documentation on un-installing modules, or
simply remove the file modules/aspectjForForte.jar from Forte's install
directory.

== Running AJDE for Forte

*3.1 Setting up the AspectJ Examples (in NetBeans 3.3.1)*

* in the "Project" menu select "Project Manager"
* Click "New..." and enter "AspectJ Examples" as the projects' name and
click "OK".
* In the "Filesystems" Explorer tab right click "Filesystems", then
select "Mount -> Local Directory".
* browse into the AspectJ install directory (e.g. "C:/apps/aspectj1.0")
* select "examples" and click "Finish"
* In the "Tools" menu select "AspectJ -> Start AJDE" or just click on
the "AJDE" (image:startAjde.gif[image]) button (shown as label 1 of the
screenshot).

*3.2 Compiling the Spacewar Example*

* After AJDE is started, a new "AspectJ" tab is added to the explorer
window. Click it. The next thing to do is to choose a particular build,
since there are many in the examples distribution. To the right of the
"Build" button (image:build.gif[image]) there is a downward arrow. Click
it, and select "spacewar/demo.lst" (as in label 2 of the screenshot).
This will start a build of the demo configuration of spacewar. Clicking
the "Build" button will rebuild.
* When the compile is finished and the "AspectJ Explorer" structure is
present navigate the structure by clicking nodes (as shown in label 3 of
the screenshot). Note that associations between nodes appear with
UML-style arrow icons and italicized names and reperesent how a
particular node in the structure relates to others. In order to navigate
these associations expand the notes and click the corresponding links
(in blue). These links represent structure nodes elsewhere in the tree.
* If there are compilation errors, clickable messages will appear (as in
label 4 of the screenshot).

*3.3 Running the Spacewar Example*

* In the "Filesystems" Explorer tab open the "spacewar" directory, right
click "spacewar/Game.java", and the select "Execute".
* When finished executing switch back to the "Editing" mode.
* Select and build the "debug.lst" configuration as described in 3.2 and
execute again--you will notice that the debug configuration adds a debug
window used for tracing by including the "Debug.java" aspect in the
compile.

3.4 Debugging the Spacewar Example

* You must first add the filesystem to the project so that the debugger
can see the main class. Do this in the "Project AspectJ Examples" tab in
the explorer by right clicking the root node and selecting "Add
Existing...".
* You may now need to add the AspectJ Runtime to the project so that the
debugger can see it. In the same way as described in 3.1 select "Mount
-> Archive (JAR, Zip)".
* Browse to the your lib/ext/aspectjrt.jar file within your NetBeans
install directory and click "Finish".
* Select "Project -> Set Project Main Class..." in the menu bar, browse
to "spacewar/Game.java" in the examples directory that you created and
click "OK".
* In the "Filesystems" Explorer tab open the "spacewar" directory, click
"Game.java", and the select "Debug -> Strat" from the menu bar.

AspectJ-related options can be modified in the AJDE settings window.
