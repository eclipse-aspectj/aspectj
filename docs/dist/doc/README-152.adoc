generated as a result of the AspectJ weaving process are now marked Java
synthetic - enabling coverage tools such as Emma to process woven
classes correctly.

has now transitioned from the CPL to the EPL license.
* https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=140695[[140695]] Using a
more optimal world for managing types when load-time weaving - reduces
heap usage (work in progress).

can now support separate output folders for each input source folder -
enables AJDT to behave more like JDT.
