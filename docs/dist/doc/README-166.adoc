=== Changes

*Java5*

The features of Java5 (generics, autoboxing, covariance, etc) are being
exploited in the AspectJ codebase. This does not in any way change the
generated code or supported source code, or the dependencies that code
has, but it *does* mean that AspectJ requires Java5 in order to run. The
ability to use typed collections has already flushed out a few issues
within the codebase, improving the quality of AspectJ.

 +

*Closing streams*

Some routes through AspectJ were leaving inputstreams open and this has
now been fixed. For example if supplying a user written configuration
file for Lint options. Thanks to Michael Pradel for supplying patches to
fix these issues.

 +

*Concurrency (281654)*

Fix to address a problem seen when using the weaver in a highly
concurrent environment. Thanks to Kristian Rosenvold for the patch.

 +

*Incremental compilation*

A few fixes to problems seen only on incremental builds, problem areas
included:

* problems when fully qualifying the target type in an intertype
declaration (269652)
* problems when using annotation style pointcuts and reference pointcuts
together (286341)

 +

*JavadocRunner in NetBeans*

Fixed by a patch from Joseph A. Levin - thanks!

 +

*Various fixes/enhancements to the structure model to fix issues with
feedback on weaving in AJDT*
