
This directory contains several examples of tracing aspects,
including a reusable tracing library and examples of 
using that library.

A lesson in the AspectJ Primer explains all of this code.

To work with these (or any other examples), first be sure .../examples
is on your classpath, where ... is where you have installed AspectJ.


--To compile and run the example without tracing--

 ajc @.../examples/tracing/notrace.lst

 java tracing.ExampleMain


--To compile and run the example with tracing version<N>--

 ajc @.../examples/tracing/tracev<N>.lst

 java tracing.version<N>.TraceMyClasses

where <N> is 1, 2, 3 or 4

--To use the tracing.lib.AbstractTrace aspect--

 Make sure .../examples is in your classpath.

 In order to use this aspect, please read the documentation under
