=== Notable changes

==== JDT Upgrade

The JDT compiler inside AspectJ has been upgraded to the Eclipse Neon.2
level (JDT commit #75dbfad0).

==== Java8

The Eclipse JDT compiler embedded inside AspectJ now requires Java 8, so
that is the minimum required level to compile sources with AspectJ.
However, if only doing weaving and no compilation then it is possible to
use Java 7.

==== Annotation style around advice and proceed (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=500035[Bug 500035])

A long standing issue that has been lurking in the handling of arguments
passed to proceed for annotation style aspects has been fixed. If, at a
joinpoint where 'this'/'target' differ (for example at some call
joinpoints), the pointcut bound either 'this' or 'target' (but not
both), then the system would still expect the advice to pass both 'this'
and 'target' into the proceed call. With the fix here you only need to
pass what you bind. So if you bind only 'this' you don't need to pass
'target' (and vice versa). This will affect users that have been working
around this quirk by passing both 'this' and 'target'. That isn't
necessary anymore. This fix is in aspectjrt.jar so you will need to be
using the 1.8.10 version of aspectjrt.jar at runtime to pickup this
change.
