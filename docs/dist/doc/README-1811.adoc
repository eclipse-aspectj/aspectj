_Release info: 1.8.11 available 26-Sep-2017_

This release is a small compatibility release to improve the behaviour
of the AspectJ 1.8 line on JDK9. Importantly it includes a change that
knows about the Java 9 version information and so does not get confused
and think it is running on something really old (which typically
manifests as it complaining about annotations not being supported on
this level of Java).

With that change this release is usable for Spring AOP use cases because
that is doing runtime pointcut matching with proxy creation rather than
actual weaving. Although if you using Spring AOP with class level
annotation retention there may still be issues. If you experience
problems or need to do actual weaving on JDK9, please use AspectJ9
instead.
