* 1.8.4 available 6-Nov-2014

=== Notable changes

==== Support for is(FinalType)

AspectJ has had type category type patterns since version 1.6.9, see the
https://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/released/README-169.html[README].
This enabled pointcuts to include is(..) clauses to specify which kinds
of type they were or were not interested in matching, e.g. !within(* &&
is(InnerType)) means not within innertypes. In 1.8.4 it is now possible
to recognize (for inclusion or exclusion) final types with
is(FinalType).

==== thisAspectInstance correctly handled with -1.8

This is the key fix in this release. Some products based on AspectJ were
using the thisAspectInstance feature (see
https://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/released/README-1612.html[README
1.6.12] for more info on the feature). Unfortunately if specifying -1.8
compliance and using the feature an error would be reported at compile
time of the aspect. This is now fixed.
