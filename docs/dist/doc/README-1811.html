<h1>AspectJ 1.8.11 Readme</h1>

<p>This release is a small compatibility release to improve the behaviour of the AspectJ 1.8
line on JDK9. Importantly it includes a change that knows about the Java 9 version information
and so does not get confused and think it is running on something really old (which typically
manifests as it complaining about annotations not being supported on this level of Java).</p>

<p>With that change this release is usable for Spring AOP use cases because that is doing
runtime pointcut matching with proxy creation rather than actual weaving. Although if you
using Spring AOP with class level annotation retention there may still be issues. If you
experience problems or need to do actual weaving on JDK9, please use AspectJ9 instead.</p>
