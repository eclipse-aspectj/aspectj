* 1.7.2 available 13-Feb-2013

=== Fixes:

* Incorrect signature attributes generated into some class files for
complex generics declarations.
* Generics information incorrectly being placed in the stackmap
verification attributes.
* Problems with generic ITDs not being picked up correctly, resulting in
'method must be implemented' errors.
* Problems with multiple usages of 'requires' clause in aop.xml for
conditional aspects.
* Generated if() pointcut representations in class files change on only
a source whitespace change.
* Intermittent problem with generic ITDs due to weak references being
collected too soon.
