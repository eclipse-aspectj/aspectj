=== 2 Install Procedure

The AspectJ tools `ajc` and `ajbrowser` are Java programs that can be
run indirectly from the scripts or directly from `aspectjtools.jar`. The
`aspectjrt.jar` needs to be on the classpath when compiling or running
programs compiled by `ajc`. This procedure shows ways to do that.

After finishing automatic installation, we recommend that the following
steps to complete your installation:

*2.1 Add `<aspectj install dir>/lib/aspectjrt.jar` to your class path*

____
This small .jar file contains classes required to compile programs with
the ajc compiler, and to run programs compiled with the ajc compiler.
You must have these classes somewhere on your class path when running
programs compiled with ajc. For detailed instructions please see the
xref:#configInstructions[Configuration Instructions] at the bottom of
this document.
____

*2.2 Put the AspectJ `bin` directory on your PATH*

____
Modify your PATH to include `<aspectj install   dir>/bin`. This will
make it easier to run ajc. For detailed instructions please see the
xref:#configInstructions[Configuration Instructions] at the bottom of
this document.
____

*2.3 Review the documentation and examples*

____
Development and programming guides are available in
link:doc/index.html[docs], and example programs and an Ant script are
available in link:doc/examples/[examples].
____

If you did not use the automatic installation process, you may wish to
create short launch scripts to start ajc easily (section 3).

=== 3. Running the Tools

If you did not use the automatic installation process or the default
launch scripts do not work on your system, you may wish to create short
launch scripts to start ajc easily.

You can also run the `aspectjtools.jar` directly using java's -jar
option:

____
`C:\jdk1.3\bin\java.exe -jar D:\aspectj\lib\aspectjtools.jar %*`
____

With no arguments or only argument list (.lst) files, this will launch
`ajbrowser`, the GUI structure browser; otherwise, it will run `ajc`,
the AspectJ compiler. This means that if your browser is set up to run
jar files, clicking a link to lib/aspectjtools.jar will launch
`ajbrowser`.

You can also create scripts like those created by the installer. These
scripts use full paths that are system dependent so you will likely have
to change these.

Here's a sample launch script for WinNT and Win2K (note that this is
single line in the .bat file):

____
`C:\jdk1.3\bin\java.exe -classpath D:\aspectj\lib\aspectjtools.jar -Xmx64M org.aspectj.tools.ajc.Main %*`
____

Here's a sample launch script for a Unix shell (on Linux using Sun's
JDK1.3):

____
`/usr/java/jdk1.3/jre/bin/java -classpath /home/aspectj/lib/aspectjtools.jar -Xmx64M org.aspectj.tools.ajc.Main "$@"`

=== [#configInstructions]#4. Configuration Instructions#

==== 4.1 Adding `<aspectj install dir>/lib/aspectjrt.jar` to your classpath

There are several ways to add this jar file to your classpath:

* copy `aspectjrt.jar` to the `jdk/jre/lib/ext` directory
* add `aspectjrt.jar` to your CLASSPATH environment variable (see the
next section for details)
* always use the "`-classpath aspectjrt.jar`" option when running
programs compiled with ajc

==== 4.2 [#6.1]#Setting the Environment Variables on Windows#

The following instructions use the PATH variable as an example, but this
process is identical for the CLASSPATH variable.

You can do the variables permanently for all the shells that you will
run or temporarily only for the current shell. To change the PATH only
in the current shell, and assuming you've installed AspectJ in
`C:\apps\aspectj`, type:

____
`> set PATH=%PATH%;C:\apps\aspectj\bin`
____

*Changing Environment Variables Permanently on WinNT and Win2000*

* open the Environment Variables dialog
** WinNT: in "Control Panels" double-click "System" and select the
"Environment" tab
** Win2K: in "Control Panels" double-click "System", select the
"Advanced" tab and click the "Environment Variables..." button
* select the environment variable for editing, or add it using the
"New..." button if it does not exist
* add the new entry separated from the others by a semi-colon (;) and
close the dialog
* note that the change will not affect shells that were already running

*Changing Environment Variables Permanently on Win9x*

* open the AUTOEXEC.BAT with an editor such as NotePad
* edit the PATH statement to include the new entry and save the file,
e.g. +
+
____
`PATH C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND;C:\;C:\DOS;C:\apps\aspectj\bin`
____
* note that the change will not affect shells that were already running
