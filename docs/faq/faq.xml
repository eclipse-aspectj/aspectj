        <answer>
          <para>
            AspectJ(tm) is a simple and practical extension to the
            Java(tm) programming
            language that adds to Java aspect-oriented programming (AOP)
            capabilities. AOP allows developers to reap the benefits of
            modularity for concerns that cut across the natural units of
            modularity. In object-oriented programs like Java, the natural unit
            of modularity is the class. In AspectJ, aspects modularize concerns that
            affect more than one class.
	  </para>
          <para>You compile your program using the AspectJ compiler
          (perhaps using the supported development environments)
          and then run it,
          supplying a small (&lt; 100K) runtime library.
          </para>
          <para>The AspectJ technologies include

        <answer>
          <para>AspectJ can be used to improve the modularity of software
            systems.
          </para>
          <para> Using ordinary Java, it can be difficult to modularize design
          concerns such as
          </para>

            <listitem><para>testing</para></listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
          <para>The code for these concerns tends to be spread out across the
            system. Because these concerns won't stay inside of any one module
            boundary, we say that they <emphasis>crosscut</emphasis> the
            system's modularity.
          </para>
          <para>AspectJ adds constructs to Java that enable the modular
            implementation of crosscutting concerns. This ability is
            particularly valuable because crosscutting concerns tend to be both
            complex and poorly localized, making them hard to deal with.
          </para>
          <!--
          <para>Initial studies have shown code size reductions of up to 40%
            and programmer productivity gains of 20%-40%. These studies were in
            an earlier version of the language and only for small sample sizes.
            So while the results are encouraging, they aren't conclusive. We
            intend to run a new set of studies once the current phase of
            language development stabilizes.</para>

          The AspectJ compiler produces programs for any released version of the
          Java platform (jdk1.1 and later).  When running, your program classes must
	      be able to reach classes in the
          small (&lt; 100K) runtime library (aspectjrt.jar) from the distribution.
          The tools themselves require J2SE 1.3 or later to run,
          but the compiler can produce classes for any 1.1-compliant
          version of the Java platform.

          <para>Many users adopt AspectJ in stages, first using it
        to understand and validate their systems (relying on it only in
        development) and then using it to implement crosscutting concerns

                  This kind of addition may be removed ("unplugged") for
                  the final build since it does not implement a design

                  production systems, so you may design the functionality
                  to be deployed but disabled, and enable it when debugging.

           structures. For many programmers this provides a deeper understanding
           of how aspects work to modularize their concerns and permits them

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
	      "Scattering" is when similar code is distributed throughout many
          program modules.  This differs from a component being used by
          many other components since
	      it involves the risk of misuse at each point and of inconsistencies
	      across all points.  Changes to the implementation may require
          finding and editing all affected code.
          </para>
          <para>"Tangling" is when two or more concerns are implemented in
	      the same body of code or component, making it more difficult to understand.
	      Changes to one implementation may cause unintended changes
	      to other tangled concerns.
          </para>
          <para>"Crosscutting" is how to characterize a concern than spans
	      multiple units of OO modularity - classes and objects.  Crosscutting
	      concerns resist modularization using normal OO constructs, but
          aspect-oriented programs can modularize crosscutting concerns.

          <para>What are join points?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>Join points are well-defined points in the execution of a
            program. Not every execution point is a join point: only those
            points that can be used in a disciplined and principled manner are.
            So, in AspectJ, the execution of a method call is a join point, but
            "the execution of the expression at line 37 in file Foo.java" is
            not.
          </para>
          <para>The rationale for restricting join points is similar to the
            rationale for restricting access to memory (pointers) or
            restricting control flow expressions (<literal>goto</literal>) in
            Java: programs are easier to understand, maintain and extend
            without the full power of the feature.
          </para>
          <para>AspectJ join points include reading or writing a field; calling

            <link linkend="q:pointcut">pointcut</link>. There are three
            kinds of advice: before advice, around advice and after advice. As
            their names suggest, before advice runs before the join point
            executes; around advice executes before and after the join point;
            and after advice executes after the join point. The power of
            advice comes from the advice being able to access values in the
            execution context of a pointcut.

        <answer>
          <para>AOP's fundamental assumption is that in any sufficiently

            concerns.

          <para>So, while there are some cases where you could re-factor a

          <para>Yes.</para>
          <para>The short summary is that it is right to define AOP in terms of

            crosscutting structure.  It would be a mistake to define AOP in

            particular to AOP, and past programming language innovations also
            do that, as will future developments.

          crosscutting in first-class constructs.  You can not only avoid the
          maintenance problems and structural requirements of some other
          mechanisms, but also combine forms of crosscutting so that all
	  the mechanisms for a particular concern are one piece of code.

          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>There are many recent proposals for programming languages that
            provide control over crosscutting concerns. Aspect-oriented
            programming is an overall framework into which many of these
            approaches fit. AspectJ is one particular instance of AOP,
            distinguished by the fact that it was designed from the ground up
            to be compatible with Java.

          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>Reflective and aspect-oriented languages have an important
            similarity: both provide programming support for dealing with
            crosscutting concerns. In this sense reflective systems proved
            that independent programming of crosscutting concerns is
            possible.
          </para>
          <para>But the control that reflection provides tends to be low-level
            and extremely powerful. In contrast, AspectJ provides more
            carefully controlled power, drawing on the rules learned from
            object-oriented development to encourage a clean and understandable
            program structure.

          <para>How do AspectJ features compare with those of mixin-based
            inheritance?
          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>Some features of AspectJ, such as introduction, are related to
            <emphasis>mixin-based inheritance</emphasis>. But, in order to
            support crosscutting, a core goal for AspectJ, AspectJ goes beyond
            mixin-based inheritance.
          </para>
          <para>Firstly, an aspect imposes behavior on a class, rather than a
            class requesting behavior from an aspect. An aspect can modify a
            class without needing to edit that class. This property is
            sometimes called <emphasis>reverse inheritance</emphasis>.
          </para>
          <para>Secondly, a single aspect can affect multiple classes in
            different ways. A single paint aspect can add different paint
            methods to all the classes that know how to paint, unlike mixin
            classes.
          </para>
          <para>
So mixin-based inheritance doesn't have the reverse inheritance
property, and mixins affect every class that mixes them in the same.
If I want to do something like SubjectObserverProtocol, I need two
mixins, SubjectPartofSubjectObserverProtocol and ObserverPartof...
In AspectJ, both halves of the protocol can be captured in a single
aspect.

          <para>How does AspectJ compare with more dynamic AOP?
          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
          Some AOP techniques are presented as "dynamic" because the weaving
          occurs when classes are loaded, because aspects can be configured
          in a separate XML file before launch, or because some advice
          depends on runtime reflection.  They are said to be more flexible
          than AspectJ.
          </para>
          <para>
          This is a misconception.  First, the AspectJ 1.1 weaver has always
          supported weaving at compile-time or class-load-time.  Weaving at
          compile-time reduces application launch and running time, and it helps
          IDE's offer support for tracking down weaving errors and understanding
          the impact of aspects on a system.
          On the other hand, weaving at load-time simplifies build and deployment.
          Before AspectJ 1.2, the user had to write a class loader that used the
          weaver API to weave at load time; since 1.2, AspectJ comes with a
          command-line launcher to support weaving at class-load-time without
          any other changes to a build configuration.  In AspectJ 5, we expect
		  to get a similar level of support as AspectWerkz, and to exploit
		  the class bytecode weaving hook available in Java 5 VM's.
          </para>
          <para>
          Second, AspectJ programs, like Java programs generally, can be
          written to support any level of XML configuration or to depend on
          runtime reflection.  There are some benefits to using AspectJ;
          e.g., the proceed() form within around advice simplifies a lot of
          the work that otherwise would go into writing a generalized
          interceptor, without introducing many of the runtime errors that can
          result from interceptors.
          For AspectJ examples of configurable or reflection-dependent programs,
          see the sample code linked off the AspectJ documentation page
          or the examples discussed on the mailing list, e.g.,

            This is Raymond Lee's answer:
          </para>
          <para>
        You're not really that confused.  AOP and XP are orthogonal concepts,
        although AOP can be used to help accomplish XP goals.
        One of the goals of XP is to respond to changing requirements.
        Another is to reduce the overall cost of development.  These are
        not necessarily the same thing.
          </para>
          <para>
        One of the principles of XP that contribute to meeting those goals
        is to maintain clean, simple designs.  One of the criteria for clean,
        simple designs is to factor out duplication from the code.  Benefits
        of removing duplication include the code being easier to understand,
        better modularity of the design, lower costs of code changes, less
        chance of conflicting changes when practicing collective code
        ownership, etc.
          </para>
          <para>
        Different types of duplication lend themselves to being addressed by
        different design paradigms and language features.  Duplicate snippets
        of code can be factored out into methods.  Duplicate methods can be
        factored out to common classes, or pushed up to base classes.
        Duplicate patterns of methods and their use can be factored out to
        mechanisms of classes and methods (i.e. instantiations of design
        patterns).
          </para>
          <para>
        AOP addresses a type of duplication that is very difficult to handle
        in the other common paradigms, namely cross-cutting concerns.  By
        factoring out duplicate cross-cutting code into aspects, the target
        code becomes simpler and cleaner, and the cross-cutting code becomes
        more centralized and modular.
          </para>
          <para>
        So, AOP as a paradigm, and the associated tools, gives an XPer, or
        anyone wanting to remove duplication from the code base, a powerful
        way to remove a form of duplication not easily addressed until now.

        <answer>
          <para>The issue of performance overhead is an important one. It is
            also quite subtle, since knowing what to measure is at least as
            important as knowing how to measure it, and neither is always
            apparent.
          </para>
          <para>We aim for the performance of our implementation of AspectJ to
          be on par with the same functionality hand-coded in Java.  Anything
          significantly less should be considered a bug.
          </para>
          <para>There is currently no benchmark suite for AOP languages in
            general or for AspectJ in particular. It is probably too early to
            develop such a suite because AspectJ needs more maturation of the
            language and the coding styles first. Coding styles really drive
            the development of the benchmark suites since they suggest what is
            important to measure.
          </para>
          <para>Though we cannot show it without a benchmark suite, we believe
          	that code generated by AspectJ has negligible performance overhead.
            Inter-type member and parent introductions should have very little
            overhead, and advice should only have some indirection which
            could be optimized away by modern VM's.
          </para>
          <para>The <literal>ajc</literal> compiler will use static typing information
            to only insert the advice and dynamic pointcut tests that are absolutely necessary.
            Unless you use 'thisJoinPoint' or 'if', the main dynamic checks will be
            'instanceof' checks which are generally quite fast.
            These checks will only be inserted when they can not be inferred from
            the static type information.
          </para>
          <para>When measuring performance, write AspectJ code
            fragments and compare them to the performance of the
            corresponding code written without AspectJ. For example, don't
            compare a method with before/after advice that grabs a lock to just
            the method. That would be comparing apples and oranges. Also be
            sure to watch out for JIT effects that come from empty method
            bodies and the like. Our experience is that they can be quite
            misleading in understanding what you've measured.

          <para>
        But seriously, most AspectJ users find that just like when they learned
        OO, it takes a while to really get the hang of it.  They tend to start
        in the usual way, by copying canonical examples and experimenting with
        variations on them.
          </para>
          <para>
        But users also find that rather than being dangerous, AspectJ helps them
        write code that is more clear and has better encapsulation -- once they
        understand the kind of modularity AspectJ supports.  There are several
        good papers that talk about this (see below), but here's a basic point
        to keep in mind: when properly used, AspectJ makes it possible program
        in a modular way, something that would otherwise be spread throughout
        the code. Consider the following code, adapted from the AspectJ tutorial:
          </para>
          <programlisting>
aspect PublicErrorLogging {
    Log log = new Log();

    pointcut publicInterface(Object o):
        call(public * com.xerox.*.*(..)) &amp;&amp; target(o);

    after(Object o) throwing (Error e): publicInterface(o) {
        log.write(o, e);
    }
}
          </programlisting>
          <para>
        The effect of this code is to ensure that whenever any public method of
        an interface or class in the <literal>com.xerox</literal> package
        throws an error, that error is logged before being thrown to its caller.
          </para>
          <para>
        Of course in the alternative implementation a large number of methods
        have a try/catch around their body.
          </para>
          <para>
        The AspectJ implementation of this crosscutting concern is clearly
        modular, whereas the other implementation is not.  As a result, if you
        want to change it, its easier in the AspectJ implementation.  For
        example, if you also want to pass the name of the method, or its
        arguments to <literal>log.write</literal>, you only have to edit
        one place in the AspectJ code.
          </para>
          <para>
        This is just a short example, but I hope it shows how what happens
        with AOP and AspectJ is that the usual benefits of modularity are
        achieved for crosscutting concerns, and that leads to better code,
        not more dangerous code.

          Introducing parents or members to classes is a well-studied OO technique
          known as open classes.
          </para>
          <para>
          Open classes have been used in many languages prior to AspectJ,
          including CLOS, Python, Smalltalk, Objective-C, and others.
          Building from Java, introduction in AspectJ provides better
          name hygiene and access control than prior languages.
          Introduced code obeys all of Java's normal accessibility rules
          for its lexical location in the aspect that it is introduced from.
          Such code can not even see, much less access, private members of
          the class it is introduced into. Further, introductions can be
          declared private to the aspect, so they are not visible to
          other clients of the class.
          </para>
          <para>
          Privileged aspects do permit access to private members of another
          class.  They are a response to the very few cases where developers
          genuinely need such access (typically for testing purposes where it
          access is necessary), but it would be more risky to open access by
          putting the aspect in the same package, adding test code, or changing
          access in the target class.  We recommend using privileged aspects
          only as necessary, and believe that marking them "privileged" makes
          any potential misuse apparent.

	The basic limitations are that there is no built-in support for writing J2EE
	analogs for AspectJ extensions to Java, like distributed aspects, distributed
	cflow, or managing state between invocations. These don't prevent one from using
	AspectJ to do useful intra-container implementation, nor need they prevent one
	from building distributed support, state management, and inter-component
	implementations that leverage AspectJ. It just takes some work. In more detail:

	All AspectJ implementations may define "code the implementation controls".
        The AspectJ 1.0 implementation defines this as the files passed to the compiler

          <para>
	EJB components may be invoked remotely, and containers may passivate and
	pool EJB's.  Servlets have similar limitations, and in both cases the
	lifespan of the defining class loader is implementation-dependent
	(though it must span the operation of a particular request).
          </para>
          <para>
	Being limited by lifecycle and namespace, the AspectJ 1.0 implementation
        supports aspects that operate through non-remote invocations during the lifetime
        of the namespace for a particular
	deployment unit compiled in its entirety by the ajc compiler.
	This means AspectJ supports common aspects only within a single local runtime
	namespace (usually implemented as a class loader hierarchy).
          </para>
          <para>
	Further, AspectJ recognizes language-level join points (object initialization,
	method calls, etc.), not their EJB analogs (ejb find or create methods...).

            What files do I need to include when compiling AspectJ programs?
          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>You need to specify to the compiler the files that
            contain your aspects and the files that contain the
            types affected by your aspects.
	    See <xref linkend="q:knowWhenAspectsAffectClasses"/>.
	    The AspectJ compiler will not search the source path for types
	    that may be affected (unlike Javac and Jikes).
	    In AspectJ 1.0, ajc requires all code to be in source form;
	    in AspectJ 1.1, Java and AspectJ code may be in either source
	    or binary form.
          </para>
          <para>In some cases you should compile your entire system all at once.
           If this is too slow, then you can try to make reasonable divisions
           between sets of source files whose aspects do not interact to
           achieve a shorter compile cycle (particularly for development
	       aspects).  If you have aspects that apply to different modules,
	       you can try compiling them into a binary form and using them
	       to weave each module.  However, if you get any problems
           or if you wish to run tests or do a release, you should recompile
           the entire system.

          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>Use the latest, greatest, fastest JVM you can get your hands on
            for your platform. The compiler's performance is dependent on the
            performance of the JVM it is running on, so the faster a JVM you
            can find to run it on, the shorter your compile times will be. At a
            minimum you need to use a Java 2 or later JVM to run the compiler
            (J2SE 1.3 for AspectJ 1.1).
            We realize that this constraint can be a problem for users who
            don't currently have a Java 2 JVM available. We're sorry for the
            inconvenience, but we had to make the hard decision that the
            advantages of being able to rely on Java 2 were worth the cost of
            losing a number of developers who are working on platforms without
            Java 2 support. Here is a list of starting places where you might
            find support for your system.

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>In AspectJ 1.0,
          the PARSER for ajc is written by hand.  This choice was made with full
          awareness of the generator tools out there.  (Jim had for example used
          the excellent javacc tool for building the parser for JPython (now Jython)).
          One of the reasons that AspectJ uses a hand-written parser is that using
          javacc taught Jim about the LL-k design for parsers (pioneered by antlr).
          As opposed to the state-machine parsers produced by yacc, these parsers are
          very readable and writable by humans.
          </para>
          <para>
            Antlr and javacc did not really suit the project:

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>
            Antlr's support for unicode in the lexer is still immature and this makes
            using it with Java challenging.  This was an even bigger issue 3 years ago
            when we started on the Java implementation of ajc.

            slightly specially which can break a few unusual pure Java programs.

            The sort of case that gives standard parser generators fits is something
            like "*1.f(..)" which no one would ever write, but which must be
            supported for a consistent language.

              <para>In incremental mode, ajc minimizes the files that need
                  to be recompiled after another file has changed.  In Java,
                  only the changed files need to be recompiled, but in AspectJ,
                  other files might also need to be recompiled or re-woven.
              </para>
                <para> Depending on what is modified, we may need to re-weave
                    code.  If you change a pointcut and save it, we currently have
                    to check everywhere in case a new match is occurring or an old
                    match is no longer correct.  However, if you simply change
                    the body of an advice in an aspect, there is (usually) no need
                    to reweave as the affected classes call the advice and the
                    advice (by design) maintains its name in the recompiled
                    aspect. </para>
                <para> If you make a change to a class (as opposed to an aspect) and
                    save it, we usually can get away with merely having to
                    compile that class then weave the existing aspects with it -
                    rather than doing a full recompile of the entire system.

                    algorithms we use, by performing more complete analysis of
                    the change made to a file that will enable us to know more
                    accurately whether we need to reweave and if we do then what
                    we need to reweave - we just haven't gotten around to
                    implementing them yet. </para>

          <para>When you are working with the IDE support, you can get an
            understanding of which aspects affect any class.
            This enables AspectJ programmers to get the benefits of
            modularizing crosscutting concerns while still having immediate
            access to what aspects affect a class.

          See <xref linkend="q:integrateWithDevTools"/> for more
            information on which Java development environments are
            supported.)
          </para>
          <para>
            When you are looking at documentation for AspectJ 1.0 programs,
            <literal>ajdoc</literal> will provide links from aspects and
            advice to the affected code, but it provides less information
            than the IDE support because it only parses declarations.
          </para>
          <para>
            When you are compiling your program, pointcuts that are
            statically-determinable can be used in declare statements
            to identify the code picked out by the pointcut.
            (A pointcut is statically determinable if it only uses
             the pointcut designators
             <literal>within</literal>,
             <literal>withincode</literal>,
             <literal>execution</literal>,
             <literal>call</literal>,
             <literal>get</literal>,
             <literal>set</literal>,
             <literal>initialiation</literal>, and
             <literal>staticinitialiation</literal>.)
             The compiler will list the static code points which will be
             affected by any advice specifying the same pointcut.
             For example, the following will print a warning
             whereever some code in class Bar gets a field value from Foo:
             <programlisting>
declare warning: get(* Foo.*) &amp;&amp; within(Bar)
   : "reading Foo state from Bar";
             </programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
            When you are running your program,
            you can trace advice as it executes.  This
            enables you to identify advice on join points picked out
            dynamically, which cannot be reflected precisely by IDE support.

            which uses the AJDE API support for IDE's.
            Supporting new IDE's is a matter of building on the AJDE API's,
            mostly likely adopting one of the existing open-source IDE
            extensions as a design template.
            Here are the IDE's where we know people have expressed interest,
            so interested developer may want to join with others in their
            developer communities to build the integration.

            We compile module jars and then assemble them.  Can we continue this with AspectJ?
          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
		Aspects apply to everything in a namespace, as if everything is
		compiled together.
		Sometimes you can break the build down into separate steps without breaking
		this model, but we haven't stated exactly where it could break
		because it depends on the interactions between all types.
		You can try the approaches below, but remember to rebuild
		everything in one go if there are problems.
		</para>
		<para>
		The simplest scenario is when the aspects apply to all modules
		and the modules compile without the aspects.  In that case,
		weaving in the aspects is just the final assembly step for
		the build.
		</para>
		<para>
		Next is the case where the aspects make changes to a common
		library that are visible to other clients, which themselves
		are otherwise unaffected by the aspects.  In this case, the
		common library can be built using ajc, and used on the
		classpath for the module builds:
		<programlisting><![CDATA[
ajc -outjar common.jar -sourceroots "aspectj-src:src" ...
cd ../otherProject
javac -classpath "../common/common.jar:${aspectjrt.jar}" {src}
]]></programlisting>
		</para>
		<para>
		Combining these last two,
		there's the case where a common set of aspects should
		affect two or more modules that are in a dependency relationship
		to one another.  It should work to reuse the aspects
		in binary form for each compile, in dependency order:

		<programlisting><![CDATA[
ajc -outjar common-aspects.jar
    -sourceroots "aspectj-src" ...

ajc -outjar common.jar
    -sourceroots "src"
    -aspectpath common-aspects.jar ...

cd ../module1
ajc -outjar module1.jar
    -sourceroots "src"
    -classpath common.jar
    -aspectpath ../common-aspects.jar ...

cd ../module2
ajc -outjar module2.jar
    -sourceroots "src"
    -classpath "common.jar;../module1.jar"
    -aspectpath ../common-aspects.jar ...
]]></programlisting>
		</para>
		<para>
		If two modules are visibly affected by aspects and
		mutually-dependent, the only thing to do is compile
		them together.
		</para>
		<para>
		It's safest to assume that all aspects can affect all
		types in a namespace; using build boundaries to effect
		crosscutting limits causes a dangerous dependency on
		the build process and might cause problems.

          <para>AspectJ does not enable you to change the signature of a method,
            but you can (by express declaration) work around some
            limits imposed by the signature.  You can convert a checked exception to
            unchecked using <literal>declare soft</literal>, privileged aspects
            have access to private methods, and you can use a percflow aspect to
            ferry additional state to a callee without changing intervening
            signatures.   For more details, see

            What is the difference between call and execution join points?

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
	    Briefly, there are two interesting times when a constructor or method is
	    run.  Those times are when it is called, and when it actually
	    executes.
          </para>
          <para>
	    The main difference is that a call join point happens outside of
	    the target object (for non-static methods) or class (for static methods
	    and constructors), and that an execution join point happens inside
	    the object or class.  This means that the <literal>within</literal>
	    and <literal>withincode</literal> pointcuts pick them out
	    differently: A call join point is picked out within the caller,
	    while an execution join point is picked
	    out where it is actually defined.
          </para>
          <para>
	    A call join point is the ``outermost'' join point for a particular
	    call.  Once a call join point proceeds, then a number of different
	    things happen.  For non-static methods, for example, method
	    dispatch happens, which will cause one method execution join point
	    -- perhaps more, if there are super calls.  For constructors, the
	    super constructor is called, and fields are initialized, and then
	    various constructor execution join points will occur.
          </para>
          <para>
	    A call join point matches only the ``external'' calls of a method
	    or constructor, based on a signature, and it does not pick out
	    calls made with <literal>super</literal>, or
	    <literal>this</literal> constructor calls.

          <para>Here's more detail:
          </para>
          <para>Consider method execution in Java as (1) the initial call from
                this object to some method on the target object with a
                particular signature; and (2) the execution of the actual code
                in the particular method dispatched in the target object.
                The call join point starts with the initial call and ends
                when control returns to the call (by return or perhaps
                thrown exception).  The execution join point starts with
                the method body and ends when the body completes (again
                by return or throwing an exception), so the execution join
                point always happens within the bounds of the corresponding
                call join point.  You can see this if you use the
	        join-point tracing aspect in see <xref linkend="q:seeingjoinpoints"/>.
          </para>
          <para>As you would expect, the context differs
                in advice on pointcuts picking out execution and call join
                points; for call, <literal>this</literal> refers to the caller, whereas
                for execution <literal>this</literal> refers to the called
                (executing) object.
          </para>
          <para>
	There are some subtle interactions with other AspectJ semantics.
	First, the meaning of the signature in the
	<literal>execution()</literal> and <literal>call()</literal>
	pointcut designators (PCD's) differ: the call type depends upon
	the type of the reference making the call, while the execution
	type depends on the enclosing class.
        Second, you may choose one over another if you cannot bring all
	your sources within the code the compiler controls
	(described in the <ulink url="progguide/semantics.html">appendix</ulink>
     to the <literal>Programming Guide</literal>).
	For example, to trace calls into a
	method from classes which are outside the code the compiler controls
	at compile time, then using <literal>execution()</literal> will work
	while using <literal>call()</literal>may not.  Finally, since
	<literal>super</literal> invocations are not considered method calls,
	to trace <literal>super.foo()</literal> would require using
	<literal>execution</literal>.
          </para>

          		Because of differences in the way AspectJ 1.0 and 1.1
          		are implemented, in 1.0
                you should use the <literal>call()</literal>
                pointcut designator unless you have a good reason to use
	        <literal>execution()</literal>; in AspectJ 1.1, the
	        reverse is true.

          <para>Static initialization pertains to initialization of

        Ordinarily, using a <literal>call</literal> pointcut designator
        is best because the call join point surrounds the others, but in
        the case of constructors there is no target object for
        the call (because it has not been constructed yet), so you
        might prefer to use the <literal>initialization</literal>

          <para>
          You can advise some form of constructor join point.
          Constructors are tricky in Java, and that's exposed in AspectJ.
          Here are some rules of thumb:
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>If you want the join point on the "outside" of object creation,
              use after returning from call to the constructor:
              </para>
              <programlisting>
after() returning (Foo newlyCreatedObject): call(Foo.new(..)) { ... }
              </programlisting>
              <para>
  You might be tempted to use "this" or "target" to expose the new object, but remember
  that if you're on the "outside" of object creation, the object itself might not be
  created yet... it only exists "on the way out", when you return the object.
              </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>If you want the join point inside a particular constructor, use:
              </para>
              <programlisting>
after(Foo newlyCreatedObject) returning: this(newlyCreatedObject) &amp;&amp; execution(Foo.new(..)) { ... }
              </programlisting>
              <para>
    Remember, though, that if you use "before" advice here, the body of the constructor
    will not have run, and so the object may be somewhat uninitialized.
              </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>
    In the rare case that there are all sorts of constructors for the object that call
    each other with <literal>this(...)</literal> and you want exactly one join point
    for each initialization of <literal>Foo</literal>, regardless of the path of
    constructors it takes, then use:
              </para>
              <programlisting>
after(Foo f) returning: this(f) &amp;&amp; initialization(Foo.new(..)) { ... }

            I want advice to run at two join points, but it doesn't run at all.  What gives?
          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
	  This usually reflects both a conceptual error and a programming mistake.
	  Most likely you want to do something like "run the advice for all
	public and private calls," and the code looks something like this:
          </para>
          <programlisting>
within(com.xerox.printing..*) &amp;&amp; call(public * *(..)) &amp;&amp; call(private * *(..))
          </programlisting>
          <para>
	But a pointcut is evaluated at *each* join point.
        The expression above would never pick out any call join point,
	because no method signature has both public and private access.
	In a pointcut, <literal>pc1() &amp;&amp; pc2()</literal> means both
	must be true at a given join point for advice to run at that join point.
	The correct pointcut would use <literal>||</literal> as follows:
          </para>
          <programlisting>
within(com.xerox.printing..*) &amp;&amp; (call(public * *(..)) || call(private * *(..)))
          </programlisting>
          <para>
            Then the advice will run at the join point.

          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>There is no way in advice to refer to the type of the
	  code executing in a static context except by specification.
	  This makes it impossible to refer to static members using
	  runtime information.
          </para>
          <para>However, AspectJ can determine the class for something
          	in the join point context, which you can use as a per-class key.
          	Then you can actually declare an instance field to contain
          	the per-class value (see the next question).  This comes at
          	the cost of an extra reference, but the field can be final.

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>Most likely this is a case of infinite recursion,
          where advice is advising itself. It presents as a
          <literal>StackOverflowError</literal>
          or silence as the VM exhausts itself in the recursion.
          </para>
          <para>Of course, infinite recursion is possible in Java:</para>
          <programlisting>
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
           main(args);
        } finally {
           main(args);
        }
    }
}
          </programlisting>
          <para>If you compile and run this program, and it will fail silently, trying
            to process the finally clause even after throwing the StackOverflowError.
          </para>
          <para>Here's a similar AspectJ program where the recursion is
          not so obvious:
          </para>
          <programlisting>
aspect A {
    after():  call(* *(..)) { System.out.println("after " + thisJoinPoint); }
}
          </programlisting>
          <para>This re-invokes itself because it advises any call.
          It invokes itself even after an exception is thrown, since
          <literal>after</literal> advice, like a finally clause, runs even
          after exceptions are thrown. You can fix this by following two practices:
          </para>
          <para>In AspectJ 1.1, the String concatenation operator (+) is
          	advised in its StringBuffer form, so if your advise uses
          	String + in a way that is picked out by your pointcut,
          	you will get infinite recursion.</para>
          <para>
          (1) Use <literal>after returning</literal> to advise normal completions
              or <literal>after throwing</literal> to advise abrupt completions.
              If you use <literal>after</literal> or <literal>after throwing</literal>,
              write the advice with the same care you would a finally clause,
              understanding that it may run after some failure.
          </para>
          <para>(2) Avoid writing advice that advises itself.  One simple way to
          do so is to exclude the code within the current aspect:
          </para>
          <programlisting>
aspect A {
    after() returning:  !within(A) &amp;&amp; call(* *(..)) {
        System.out.println("after " + thisJoinPoint);
    }
}
          </programlisting>
          <para>A better way is often to re-write the pointcut.
          If the advice is advising itself accidentally, that's a sign that
          the pointcut is not saying what you mean.
          </para>
          <programlisting>
aspect A {
    pointcut withinTargetClasses() : within(A+) || within(B+);
    after() returning:  withinTargetClasses() &amp;&amp; call(* *(..)) {

        When working with an unsupported IDE that objects to the syntax of

        you can use the .aj extension for your AspectJ files.
        The ajc compiler accepts both .java and .aj files, and you can
        set up your build scripts to include the correct list of
        source files.  (You will have to find another editor for
        editing AspectJ files; you can use the ajbrowser to view

          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
        The ajc compiler does more analysis than (e.g.,) javac,
        and AJDE may in some IDE's hold a copy of the structure tree until the
        next tree is available from the compile process.  Both mean that you may
        need extra memory to compile the same program.  However, increasing
        available memory to the point that you are swapping to disk can
        slow the process considerably.
          </para>
          <para>
        If you are having problems and would like to find the optimal memory
        allocation, iteratively decrease the amount of memory available until
        AJDE or ajc signals out-of-memory errors, and then increase that
        amount by 5-10%.
          </para>
          <para>
        To increase memory for the ajc compiler, see <xref linkend="q:ajcoom"/>.
        For your IDE, do something similar or follow the provider's instructions.
        For example, to increase memory in JBuilder, edit the
        <literal>jbuilderX/bin/jbuilder.config</literal>
        file to have an entry like:
<programlisting>
vmparam -Xmx384m
</programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
        If it turns out that your project is too big to use with AJDE, your IDE
        may nonetheless support external commands or Ant build processes, which
        run outside the IDE memory space.  For a JBuilder Ant plugin, some
        people have directed us to <ulink url="http://antrunner.sourceforge.net"/>.

        <answer>
          <para>
          	When advice is not running,
          	there is probably a problem in the pointcut.
          Sometimes users specify pointcuts that
          do not mean what they intend -
	      most often when they misspell a type name. Run the compiler in
	      <literal>-Xlint</literal> mode, which will flag some likely mistakes,
	      like the type name.
          If that does not work, and your pointcut is staticly-determinable,
          use a declare statement to identify affected code.  (For more
          information, see <xref linkend="q:knowWhenAspectsAffectClasses"/>.)
          If that does not work and your pointcut is dynamically determined,
          see if your join points are executing at all by using
              TraceJoinPoints.java from <xref linkend="q:seeingjoinpoints"/>.
          </para>
          <para>When advice is running more than it should, either
          	(1) your advice is in an abstract aspect and the pointcut picks
          	out the same join point for more than one concrete instantiation
          	of the aspect, or
          	(2) your pointcut picks out more join points than you intend.
          </para>

          In the case of advice in abstract aspects, the advice will run once
          for each concrete instance of the aspect.
          If the pointcut for that advice picks out the same join point for two
          concrete aspects, then the correct behavior is for the advice to run
          the advice twice at that join point.
          </para>
          <para>
          To see if your pointcut picks out the join points you intend, you
          can use IDE support, logging, or declare-warnings.
          If you are using IDE support, you should be able to trace back from
          the pointcut or advice to the join points which can be statically
          determined to be affected.
          Without IDE support, you can write
          declare-warning statements to identify code affected by staticly-
          determinable pointcuts.
          To identify advised dynamic join points,
          you can try using <literal>TraceJoinPoints.java</literal> as above,
          or update the advice to print the source location of the join point.
          Doing any of these should show if the advice applies to code that
          you did not expect.

          <para>When declaring parents on other types from an aspect, package access only

	  AspectJ does not "inject" or "generate" code.  In AspectJ the

	  and the advice constructs define additional code to run at those
	  join points.
          </para>

	  So the semantic model of advice is like the semantic model of a

          <para>
	  People who worked with earlier versions of AspectJ, in which ajc

	  This distinction is important for two reasons.  One is that thinking

        <answer>
          <para>When running classes produced by the AspectJ weaver or compiler,
              there are no significant hidden uses of memory.  As would be expected,
              each aspect is instantiated.  The per-object aspects (like
              <literal>pertarget</literal> or <literal>perthis</literal>)
			  in some implementations
              use a map to link aspects and the associated object.  When using

              is used to track control flow for each affected thread.
		  </para>
		  <para>Of course, the size and code in an aspect can require memory.
			  Aside from normal Java practices, take care with join point references.
              When referencing the static part of a join point (e.g.,
              <literal>thisJoinPointStaticPart</literal>), only one object is
              created.  However, if you reference the join point itself
              (e.g., <literal>thisJoinPoint</literal>), then one
              <literal>JoinPoint</literal> object will be created for each
              join point running advice.
		  </para>
		  <para>Aspect instances will be garbage collected just like regular objects
			  after there are no more strong references to them.  For the default
			  aspect instantiation model, <literal>issingleton</literal>, the aspect
			  class retains a reference to the singleton instance, in order to
			  implement <literal>static {AspectClass} aspectOf()</literal>, so

		  <para>Finally, when using load-time weaving, the weaver can require

              to the aspects required to weave for some time.  There are
              strategies for minimizing this (with different trade-off's),
              so the time and memory required for load-time weaving will
              vary as load-time weaving evolves.

          <para>I get a VerifyError when running CGLIB generated code that has been woven by
          AspectJ. Why is this?
          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>When weaving after advice into any piece of code, the AspectJ strategy is to make all
          exit points from that code jump to a single exit point that executes the advice
          before returning.  There is a verifier rule in the JVM specification that specifies
          that all routes to a jump destination must have the same height stack when they get there,
          regardless of the route taken to get there through the bytecode.  The CGLIB generated code has different
          stack heights at the various exit points.  This is not a problem with the CGLIB generated code,
          it is perfectly valid - it is just unusual and the AspectJ weaving strategy causes the
          verify error to trigger when it makes all exits jump to a single destination.
          </para>
          <para>AspectJ could cope with this and instead implement after advice by calling the
          advice and returning at each exit point.  However, it is unlikely that the user
          actually meant to weave the CGLIB generated code in the first place - and so usually
          the right thing to do is to exclude CGLIB generate code from the weaving process by
          appropriate use of the exclude element in the aop.xml.  A typical clause in the aop.xml might
          look as follows:
          </para>
           <programlisting>

          <para>From the message sent to users:
          </para>
          <para>
            AspectJ has come a long way -- the language has
            stabilized; there are a rapidly growing number of
            commercial users; the 1.1 release is imminent and will
            include byte-code weaving and incremental compilation;
            and the tool support is now well integrated with several
            major IDEs.
          </para>
          <para>
            This growth of the community and the technology means
            that the original research and prototype development of
            AspectJ is complete. As such it is time for ongoing
            development and support of AspectJ to move outside of
            PARC. This has already started to happen; the Eclipse
            AJDT plug-in and the several books in preparation are
            examples.
          </para>
          <para>
            To encourage the growth of the AspectJ technology and
            community, PARC is transferring AspectJ to an
            openly-developed eclipse.org project. This project will
            include documentation, web site, mailing lists, bug
            database, and sources for the compiler. The
            command-line AspectJ compiler is still the primary tool
            produced by this project, in addition to APIs that support
            integration with a variety of IDEs. The Eclipse plug-in will
            remain at eclipse.org, while the NetBeans, JBuilder and
            Emacs support will move to SourceForge.net projects.
            We look forward to your involvement with and
            contribution to those projects.

          <para>
            We see Eclipse as an excellent new home for core
            AspectJ technology development -- it is an active
            community of Open Source development and innovation
            in the Java space. Once development moves to
            Eclipse.org, others will be able to contribute more easily.

                AspectJ programs and use the AspectJ structure browser.

		  <para>AJDT is an eclipse project to integrate AspectJ

          <para>This is the right level of separation/integration.
          AspectJ is available standalone, leverages an existing open-source

          doing IDE integrations in Eclipse, Emacs, JBuilder, and NetBeans
          through a common API, AJDE.

            Should I use code- or annotation-style aspects?

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            To use AspectJ, you can use the original code-style aspects
            or the annotation-style aspects new in AspectJ 5.
          </para>
          <para>
            The original code-style is a small extension of the Java language
            designed to express crosscutting as clearly as possible
            in ways familiar to most Java programmers.
            To use the original code-style aspects,
            compile them with the AspectJ compiler or weave
            pre-compiled binary aspects using the AspectJ binary (.class)
            weaver, either at build-time or at class-load-time.
            Code-style aspects have excellent IDE support, allowing
            you to navigate to and from affected source code.
          </para>
          <para>
            Annotation-style
            aspects are written (not surprisingly) using annotations.
            They use the subset of the AspectJ language that works
            when aspects are woven after the code is compiled.
            The source files are compiled with Javac, which simply saves the
            annotations in the .class files.  The resulting .class files
              must be woven using
            the AspectJ weaver, which reads the annotations from the
            .class file and uses them to define aspects.
            Annotation-style aspects have the benefit of being compilable
              by Javac, but you can't use the full AspectJ language,
              and you don't enjoy the same level of IDE support
              for viewing crosscutting structure.

          <para>
              While the AspectJ weaver could be used at load-time in previous
              releases, the AspectJ 5 release supports much better integration
              with the Java 5 VM and the BEA JRocket JVM.  It also supports
              an XML file for configuration that allows deployers to declare
              concrete aspects using only XML.  This means aspect developers
              can write abstract aspects, and deployers need only configure
              <literal>aop.xml</literal> and run using the AspectJ weaver in Java 5.

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>You have two choices based on how wide you want the weaving to take effect: application-server wide and application-specific weaving.
          You choose between the two by loading aspect artifacts--aspects, associated types, and aop.xml--through the right classloader.
          The aop.xml must be in the META-INF directory on the classpath for the chosen classloader. In either case, you modify the
          startup script to specify the -javaagent:path-to/aspectjweaver.jar option to the Java virtual machine. Note that it is not
          essential that all the artifacts be placed in a single jar.
          </para>
          <para>For application-server wide weaving, you make aspect artifacts accessible to the server's classloader. Typically, you
          achieve such access by putting these artifacts in the server's lib directory. For example, for Tomcat, you will place
          the aspect artifacts in the TOMCAT_HOME/lib directory.</para>
		  <para>For application-specific weaving, you make aspect artifacts accessible to application classloader by bundling
		  them along with application's classes. For example, for a web application, you will place the aspect artifacts in
		  the MY_APP/WEB-INF/lib and/or MY_APP/WEB-INF/classes directory.</para>
	      <para>
		  We recommend that you start with application-specific weaving.

          The only time that reflection is used during run-time is when the special
          thisJoinPoint object is used to discover reflective information about the
          join point.  If you don't use thisJoinPoint then no reflection will be used.

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
          Since the 1.1 release, AspectJ can weave binary aspects
          into classes in bytecode form.  Hooked up to a class loader,
          this can weave class bytecodes after they are read in,
          before the
          class is defined by the VM.  (This means load-time weaving
          only works were aspects are not required to compile the pure-java
          classes.  If the aspects are required, then the Java classes
          have to be compiled with the aspects using the AspectJ compiler.)
              The AspectJ 1.2 release had the
              WeavingURLClassLoader, and the 1.2.1 release introduced
              the aj.bat script for Java 1.4.
              The AspectJ 5 release introduces much better support for
              load-time weaving, including declaring concrete aspects
              in XML files and integrating with Java 5 and BEA JRocket
              JVM's.  See <xref linkend="q:aspectj5ltw"/>.
          </para>
          <para>Some have asked about only weaving particular classes
          specified at run-time.
		  Aspects should work across an entire namespace, and problems
		  will likely result from weaving
          some classes but not others.  Also, it's confusing to
          specify crosscutting both in the aspect and in the
          list of runtime classes; the crosscutting specification
          should be in the aspect itself,
          where it can be processed by tools.
          </para>
          <para>And just to state the obvious:
          do not use bytecode weaving, at load-time or otherwise,
          to modify .class files protected by license,
          without permission from the licensor.

                 The quality of the mailing lists makes a huge difference

                 Also, the time that experienced users take in answering emails
                 can directly translate to time developers can use (instead)

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>You can attach files to a bug after it has been created.
          The code of course should replicate the actual behavior
          described in the bug when run on the target version.
          If you have a single source file, you can attach it directly,
          describing in the comments the expected result
          (e.g., error on line 14, or successful compile/run).
          The most helpful form for describing the test scenario
          and the expected results are the test definitions
          described next.
          </para>
          <para>For more complex bugs requiring many files,
          create a zip file of a directory containing all the files
          and an XML test definition file.
          The XML test definition file contains specifications
          for how to compile, recompile, or run the test sources.
          Complete documentation is available in the CVS tree
          at <literal>tests/readme-writing-compiler-tests.html</literal>
          but here is a sample file with some example definitions,
          preceded by comments showing the directory layout
          of the files referred to in the test definitions.

        <answer>
          <para>The AspectJ bytecode weaver has used BCEL for bytecode manipulation
			  since its first release.  We have upgraded it extensively, to improve
			  performance, support Java 5, etc.  The BCEL developers have not
			  incorporated our patches, so we continue to maintain our own version.
			  Ours has been optimized for the AspectJ weaver and battle-hardened
			  over years of development and use.  At some point in the future,
			  the AspectJ weaver might be restructured to make it easy to see
			  whether another bytecode package offers the same stability,
			  functionality, and performance, but for now we prefer using something
			  that we know works well.
          </para>
          <para>
			  In the AspectJ 5 release, the weaver has been restructured to
			  use reflection where possible.  Otherwise, it
			  continues to use BCEL, but does not hold BCEL structures in
			  memory after our evaluation completes.

          from the command line.

	The best compiler bug report is a reproducible test case,
	standalone code that demonstrates the problem.
	Sometimes with aspects, a test case requires several
	files, if not some way to capture the behavior.
	Here's how we recommend submitting test cases:
            <orderedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>
	Write the test case so that when the compiler bug
  	is fixed, the test completes normally without output
  	(e.g., expected compiler errors are issued,
   	or classes produced run correctly).  This usually
    means writing one or more source files.
                </para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>
	In the bug report, briefly summarize the bug.
	If it is not obvious, be sure to specify
	the expected output/behavior (e.g., compiler error on line 32)
	and, if the compile should complete, the main class to run.

          <para>What are your plans to make AspectJ a general feature
            of Java supported by Sun and the other key players in the Java
            Industry?
          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>Although we are committed to making AspectJ available to a wide
            range of users, it is too early to decide on a strategy. Some
            options include continuing AspectJ as a stand-alone product,
            integrating it into IDEs, or possibly incorporating it into
            standard Java with Sun's blessing.
          </para>
          <para>We currently focus on developing for the 1.1 implementation
            which improves AspectJ in key areas: rapid
            incremental compilation, bytecode weaving, and IDE integration.
          </para>
          <para>Through all of this our goal is to make AspectJ integrate as
            seamlessly as possible with the Java programming language. The
            AspectJ language design is becoming more integrated, the compiler
            is becoming faster and more integrated, the IDE extensions are
            becoming more integrated. All of this is designed to help users
            really use AspectJ and give us feedback on it.
          </para>
          <para>As the system is improved and we work more closely
            with users, we will be in good position to explore the best path
            for AspectJ in the long term.

          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>Bytecode weaving is in AspectJ 1.1.  We believe it
	   works as described in an email to the users list by Jim Hugugin:
          </para>
          <para>
              The AspectJ language was designed to support weaving at many different times:
              compile, load, or even run-time in the JVM.  Weaving into bytecodes at both
              compile and load-time will definitely be provided in a future release.  This
              will allow weaving at compile-time into libraries for which source code is
              not available.  It will also support aspect-aware class loaders that can
              perform weaving at load time on arbitrary classes.  One advantage of a
              language like AspectJ, rather than an explicit meta-tool like jiapi, is
              that it separates the specification of a crosscutting concern from any
              particular implementation strategy for weaving.
          </para>
          <para>
              ...AspectJ provides a language that can cleanly
              capture crosscutting concerns while preserving the static type checking,
              modularity, and composability of Java.
          </para>
          <para>If you have an application for using aspects and bytecode,
              please let the AspectJ team know of your requirements.
              We expect to have a demonstration classloader available in
              the 1.1 release or soon thereafter.

        <answer>
	  <para>The AspectJ team aims to keep the implementation bug-free and

	 	to limit AspectJ language changes to those that
