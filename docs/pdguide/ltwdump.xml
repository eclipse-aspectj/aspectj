        <para>
        	Very rarely problems may be encountered with classes that have been
        	load-time woven.
        	Symptoms will include incorrect program function or a Java exception such as
        	<literal>java.lang.VerifyError</literal>.
            In these situations it's most helpful to include the offending class
            in the bug report. When using load-time weaving the woven classes are
            in memory only so to save them to disk configure
            <literal>META-INF/aop.xml</literal> to dump the classes (by default
            to an <literal>_ajdump</literal> subdirectory of the current working
            directory).  Also if the input class file is not available
            (e.g. it is a generated proxy or has already been instrumented by another agent)
            you can configure the weaver to dump the input classes as well.

            <para> The following <literal>META-INF/aop.xml</literal> will
            weave classes in the <literal>com.foo</literal> package (and subpackages) but not
            CGLIB generated classes in the <literal>com.foo.bar</literal> package (and subpackages).
            It will also ensure all
            woven byte-code is dumped both before and after weaving. </para>
