=== Introduction

This chapter consists of very short snippets of AspectJ code, typically
pointcuts, that are particularly evocative or useful. This section is a
work in progress.

Here's an example of how to enfore a rule that code in the java.sql
package can only be used from one particular package in your system.
This doesn't require any access to code in the java.sql package.

....
/* Any call to methods or constructors in java.sql */
pointcut restrictedCall():
    call(* java.sql.*.*(..)) || call(java.sql.*.new(..));

/* Any code in my system not in the sqlAccess package */
pointcut illegalSource():
    within(com.foo..*) && !within(com.foo.sqlAccess.*);

declare error: restrictedCall() && illegalSource():
    "java.sql package can only be accessed from com.foo.sqlAccess";
....

Any call to an instance of a subtype of AbstractFacade whose class is
not exactly equal to AbstractFacade:

....
pointcut nonAbstract(AbstractFacade af):
    call(* *(..))
    && target(af)
    && !if(af.getClass() == AbstractFacade.class);
....

If AbstractFacade is an abstract class or an interface, then every
instance must be of a subtype and you can replace this with:

....
pointcut nonAbstract(AbstractFacade af):
    call(* *(..))
    && target(af);
....

Any call to a method which is defined by a subtype of AbstractFacade,
but which isn't defined by the type AbstractFacade itself:

....
pointcut callToUndefinedMethod():
     call(* AbstractFacade+.*(..))
     && !call(* AbstractFacade.*(..));
....

The execution of a method that is defined in the source code for a type
that is a subtype of AbstractFacade but not in AbstractFacade itself:

....
pointcut executionOfUndefinedMethod():
    execution(* *(..))
    && within(AbstractFacade+)
    && !within(AbstractFacade)
....
