== AspectJ Documentation and Resources

AspectJ^TM^ is a seamless aspect-oriented extension to Java^TM^. The compiler and development tools are available under
an open-source license, require Java 8 to run, and produce code that runs in JDK 1.3 and later VM's. For the latest
materials, see https://eclipse.org/aspectj. Not all of these materials have been updated for AspectJ 5.

[[paths]]
=== Suggested learning paths for those new to AspectJ

To learn the AspectJ language, read the xref:progguide/index.adoc[Programming Guide], keeping the
xref:progguide/semantics.adoc[Semantics appendix] nearby as the best reference for AspectJ usage. Focus initially on the
join point model and pointcuts, concepts AOP adds to OOP. To read about how the link:examples[examples] work, see the
xref:progguide/examples.adoc[Examples] section in the xref:progguide/index.adoc[Programming Guide]. View and navigate
the crosscutting structure using https://eclipse.org/ajdt[AJDT].

To start using AspectJ with your own code, modify the example aspects to apply to your classes. As you learn, use the
compiler's `-Xlint` flags to catch some common mistakes. (Understand that the
xref:progguide/implementation.adoc[current implementation] is limited to code the compiler controls.)

To plan how to adopt AspectJ into a project, read the xref:progguide/index.adoc[Programming Guide] on development- and
production-time aspects and the FAQ entries for xref:faq/faq.adoc#howToStartUsing[How should I start using AspectJ?],
xref:faq/faq.adoc#adoption[Deciding to adopt AspectJ], the Development tools sections
(xref:faq/faq.adoc#integrateWithDevTools[How does AspectJ integrate with existing Java development tools?],
xref:faq/faq.adoc#devtools[Integrating AspectJ into your development environment],
xref:faq/faq.adoc#ltw[Load-time weaving]), and xref:faq/faq.adoc#opensource[AspectJ as open-source]).

Enjoy the language!
