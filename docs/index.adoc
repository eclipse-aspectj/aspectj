== AspectJ Documentation and Resources

AspectJ^TM^ is a seamless aspect-oriented extension to
Java^TM^. The compiler and development tools are available
under an open-source license, require Java 8 to run, and produce code
that runs in JDK 1.3 and later VM's. For the latest materials, see
https://eclipse.org/aspectj. Not all of these materials have been updated
for AspectJ 5.

|Documentation |Description
|xref:dist/doc/quick5.pdf[AspectJ 5 Quick Reference] |This is a four-page quick
reference for the AspectJ 5 language.

|xref:dist/doc/quick.pdf[AspectJ Quick Reference] |This is a two-page quick
reference for the AspectJ language.

|xref:adk15notebook/index.adoc[AspectJ 5 Developer's Notebook] +
(xref:adk15notebook/adk15notebook.adoc[single page]) |This describes the
changes to the AspectJ language and tools introduced in the AspectJ 5
Development Kit. These changes are additive, and are not yet reflected
in the programming guide or quick reference.

applications. xref:progguide/language.adoc[The AspectJ Language]
describes join points, pointcuts, advice, and introduction, all features
new to AOP. xref:progguide/examples.adoc[Examples] walks you through the
examples included with the documentation, and there are two short
chapters on useful xref:progguide/idioms.adoc[Idioms] and a few
xref:progguide/pitfalls.html[Pitfalls] The appendices have reference
information: the xref:progguide/quickreference.adoc[Quick Reference] summarizes
AspectJ syntax, the xref:progguide/semantics.adoc[Language Semantics]
best describes AspectJ usage, and
xref:progguide/implementation.adoc[Implementation Notes] describes how
the current version is limited to code the compiler controls.

[[paths]]
=== Suggested learning paths for those new to AspectJ

To learn the AspectJ language, read the
xref:progguide/index.adoc[Programming Guide], keeping the
xref:progguide/semantics.adoc[Semantics appendix] nearby as the best
reference for AspectJ usage. Focus initially on the join point model and
pointcuts, concepts AOP adds to OOP. To read about how the
link:https://github.com/eclipse-aspectj/aspectj/tree/master/docs/dist/doc/examples[examples] work, see the
xref:progguide/examples.adoc[Examples] section in the
xref:progguide/index.adoc[Programming Guide]. View and navigate the
crosscutting structure using https://eclipse.org/ajdt[AJDT].

To start using AspectJ with your own code, modify the example aspects to
apply to your classes. As you learn, use the compiler's `-Xlint` flags
to catch some common mistakes. (Understand that the
xref:progguide/implementation.adoc[current implementation] is limited to
code the compiler controls.)

To plan how to adopt AspectJ into a project, read the
xref:progguide/index.adoc[Programming Guide] on development- and
production-time aspects and the FAQ entries for
xref:faq/faq.adoc#howToStartUsing[How should I start using AspectJ?],
xref:faq/faq.adoc#adoption[Deciding to adopt AspectJ], the Development tools
sections (xref:faq/faq.adoc#integrateWithDevTools[How does AspectJ integrate with existing Java development tools?],
xref:faq/faq.adoc#devtools[Integrating AspectJ into your development environment], xref:faq/faq.adoc#ltw[Load-time weaving]), and
xref:faq/faq.adoc#opensource[AspectJ as open-source].

Enjoy the language!
