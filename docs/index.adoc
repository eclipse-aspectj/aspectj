== AspectJ Documentation and Resources

AspectJ^TM^ is a seamless aspect-oriented extension to
Java^TM^. The compiler and development tools are available
under an open-source license, require Java 8 to run, and produce code
that runs in JDK 1.3 and later VM's. For the latest materials, see
https://eclipse.org/aspectj. Not all of these materials have been updated
for AspectJ 5.

|xref:../../adk15notebook/adk15notebook.adoc[AspectJ 5 Developer's Notebook] +
(printable link:adk15notebook/printable.html[html]) |This describes the
changes to the AspectJ language and tools introduced in the AspectJ 5
Development Kit. These changes are additive, and are not yet reflected
in the programming guide or quick reference.

|link:progguide/index.html[Programming Guide] +
(printable link:progguide/printable.html[html]) |This introduces AOP and the
AspectJ language. link:progguide/starting.html[Getting Started]
describes basic semantics, and shows development- and production-time
applications. link:progguide/language.html[The AspectJ Language]
describes join points, pointcuts, advice, and introduction, all features
new to AOP. link:progguide/examples.html[Examples] walks you through the
examples included with the documentation, and there are two short
chapters on useful link:progguide/idioms.html[Idioms] and a few
link:progguide/pitfalls.html[Pitfalls] The appendices have reference
information: the link:progguide/quick.html[Quick Reference] summarizes
AspectJ syntax, the link:progguide/semantics.html[Language Semantics]
best describes AspectJ usage, and
link:progguide/implementation.html[Implementation Notes] describes how
the current version is limited to code the compiler controls.

|link:devguide/index.html[Development Environment Guide] +
(printable link:devguide/printable.html[html]) |This is a guide to
link:devguide/ajc-ref.html[ajc], the command-line compiler;
link:devguide/ajbrowser.html[ajbrowser], the stand-alone GUI for
compiling and viewing crosscutting structure; and the

various features available such as messages and trace to help you both
solve problems with you own programs and report bugs to the AspectJ
team.

[[paths]]
=== Suggested learning paths for those new to AspectJ

To learn the AspectJ language, read the
link:progguide/index.html[Programming Guide], keeping the
link:progguide/semantics.html[Semantics appendix] nearby as the best
reference for AspectJ usage. Focus initially on the join point model and
pointcuts, concepts AOP adds to OOP. To read about how the
link:examples/[examples] work, see the
link:progguide/examples.html[Examples] section in the
link:progguide/index.html[Programming Guide]. View and navigate the
crosscutting structure using https://eclipse.org/ajdt[AJDT]; if you can't
use Eclipse, try the `ajbrowser` structure viewer, as described in the
link:devguide/ajbrowser.html[AspectJ Browser] section of the
link:devguide/index.html[Development Environment Guide].

To start using AspectJ with your own code, modify the example aspects to
apply to your classes. As you learn, use the compiler's `-Xlint` flags
to catch some common mistakes. (Understand that the
link:progguide/implementation.html[current implementation] is limited to
code the compiler controls.)

To plan how to adopt AspectJ into a project, read the
link:progguide/index.html[Programming Guide] on development- and
production-time aspects and the FAQ entries for
xref:../../faq/faq.adoc#howToStartUsing[How should I start using AspectJ?],
xref:../../faq/faq.adoc#adoption[Deciding to adopt AspectJ], the Development tools
sections (xref:../../faq/faq.adoc#integrateWithDevTools[How does AspectJ integrate with existing Java development tools?],
xref:../../faq/faq.adoc#devtools[Integrating AspectJ into your development environment], xref:../../faq/faq.adoc#ltw[Load-time weaving]), and
xref:../../faq/faq.adoc#opensource[AspectJ as open-source].

Enjoy the language!
