== AspectJ Patterns

_Last updated: 2004-03-31 by wisberg_

This directory contains Java and AspectJ implementations of the patterns
described in the "Design Patterns" book by the so-called gang-of-four
(Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides). Jan Hannemann from UBC contributed
the code under the Mozilla Public License 1.0. For more details, see
xref:docs/readme.adoc[].

Build options

* To build the code manually with ajc, use the corresponding build.lst
  files, creating the aspect library first (to create lib.jar).
* Ajbrowser and the other IDE support does not support options like
  sourceroots or -outjar in the .lst files, so you'll have to create new
  .lst files if you want to build portions of the project in an IDE.
* To build with eclipse, there are .project and .classpath files, but
  you will need to adjust the `aspectjrt.jar` entry after importing the
  project.
* To build for testing, see patterns-test.xml.

Enjoy!
