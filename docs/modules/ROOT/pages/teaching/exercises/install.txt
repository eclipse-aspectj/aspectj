0. Install

  Now get the directory "aj-@aj.event@/".  Just copy the
  "aj-@aj.event@/" directory from the provided CD.

  If you're running a Windows machine, we recommend you copy into
  "c:\".  If you're running your favorite Unix (we've had success under
  Linux and MacOS X), we recommend you install into "~\".

1. Configure

  Our installation is fairly well self-contained, but it does need to know
  where Java lives.  To do this you must set the environment variable named
  JAVA_HOME.  This variable should point to something like

    c:\apps\jdk1.3.1_04
    /usr/java
    /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK/Home

  depending on your system.  You may either do this globally, or you may
  edit the appropriate setpaths script:

    setpaths.bat          (under Windows)
    setpaths.sh           (if you run bash/sh/ksh, like most Linux setups)
    setpaths.csh          (if you run csh, like most MacOS X setups)      

  Also, if you installed into a directory other than "c:\" or "~/", then you
  need to change the EXTRACTION environment variable in the setpaths script.

2. Test

  Open a new command shell and change to the "aj-@aj.event@/" directory.

  We have provided a "setpaths" script to set permissions and various paths
  variables, so run this script:

    > setpaths.bat         (under Windows)
    > source setpaths.sh   (if you run bash/sh/ksh, like most Linux setups)
    > source setpaths.csh  (if you run csh, like most MacOS X setups)      

  You must remember to run this script every time you open a new command
  shell.

  Now, compile the core system with ajc:

    > ajc -argfile guibase.lst

  This should compile the figures application (source code in the figures
  directory) as well as a single unit test (source code in the tests
  directory).

  See if the compile was successful by running the gui figures app you just
  compiled:

    > java figures.gui.Main

  And, after quitting out of the gui figures app, run the unit test:

    > java tests.Test
    ....
    Time: 0.076

    OK (4 tests)
