How Compilation Progresses in the JDT:
======================================

Compiler.compile(ICompilationUnit[] sourceUnits) {

  foreach sourceUnit
    create a new CompilationUnitResult
    CompilationUnitDeclaration = parser.parse(sourceUnit, result)
    remember CompilationUnitDeclaration (holds ref to result) in
      "unitsToProcess"
  end

  foreach unitToProcess
    resolve 
    analyse 
    generateCode
      puts class files (plural) into CompilationUnitResult

    unit.cleanup (discards AST info etc.)
    requestor.acceptResult(result)  -- each requestor does there own thing
    discard CompilationUnitDeclaration
  end
}

Some portions of the JDT call the resolve method instead of compile,
this works the same way except that there is only a single sourceUnit
passed to the compiler, and the code generation phase is optional
(controlled by flag passed by caller).


How (batch) Compilation Progresses in AspectJ 1.1.x
===================================================

AjBuildManager.doBuild() {

  init phase
  ----------
  new AjState().prepareForNextBuild()
    builds empty lists to hold classes etc.

  setUpModel()  // this stage should be omitted unless s.one wants it

  new BcelWorld(classpath)
  new BcelWeaver(world)

  add all aspectpath entries to weaver
  add all injars to weaver
  add all inpath entries to weaver
  add all source path *resources* to weaver

  compile phase
  -------------
  build name environment, lookup environment, problem reporter and
  compiler

  compiler.compile() 
   proceeds as above, we pass in a requestor that adds the 
   resulting class files in the result into a list of addedClassFiles
   in AjState

  weave phase
  -----------
  add the addedClassFiles to the weaver
  
  pass over all class files known to weaver, building xcut set
  pass over all types, adding interTypeMungers to them
  pass over all aspects, weave them
  pass over all classes, weave them

  write out any resources added to weaver 
}

How we want (batch) compilation to proceed in AspectJ 1.2
=========================================================

The key design goal is to do all the work inside the compile method of
the compiler (this makes life much easier for integration with the
rest of the JDT that, quite reasonably, expects the class files to be
ready for action once a compile has completed). The second design goal
is that it should be up to the requestor passed into the compiler
whether or not the class files actually get written out to disk
(different parts of the JDT pass in many different kinds of requestors
that do different things).

This simple model ignores aspectpath, inpath, injars, outjar,
sourceDirs for now.

Compiler.compile(ICompilationUnit[] sourceUnits) {

  initial parse phase
  -------------------
  foreach sourceUnit
    create a new CompilationUnitResult
    CompilationUnitDeclaration = parser.parse(sourceUnit, result)
    remember CompilationUnitDeclaration (holds ref to result) in
      "unitsToProcess"
  end

  generate phase
  --------------
  foreach unitToProcess
    resolve 
    analyse 
    generateCode
      puts class files (plural) into CompilationUnitResult

    unit.cleanup (discards AST info etc.)
    
    // up to this point we are identical to JDT current behaviour,
    // from now on we deviate
    resultsPendingWeave.add(result)
    discard CompilationUnitDeclaration
  end

  weave phase
  -----------
  //createWorldAndWeaver(classpath)
  //the world and weaver have to be passed into the compiler, to
  //support incremental use cases.

  buildXCutSet(resultsPendingWeave)
  addTypeMungers(resultsPendingWeave)
  weaveAspects(resultsPendingWeave)
  weaveClasses(resultsPendingWeave)

  completion phase
  ----------------
  foreach resultPendingWeave
    requestor.acceptResult(result)  -- each requestor does their own
                                       thing
  end

  // note : movement of any resouces is moved to outside of compile
  // altogether. In eclipse, the xxxImageBuilders handle this.   
}


buildXCutSet(resultsPendingWeave) {
  foreach resultPendingWeave
    foreach classfile
      resolve
      if aspect, add to xcut set.
    end
  end
}

addTypeMungers(resultsPendingWeave) {
  foreach resultPendingWeave
    foreach classfile
      resolve
      addTypeMungers
    end
  end
}

weaveAspect(resultsPendingWeave) {
  foreach resultPendingWeave
    foreach classfile
      get corresponding BcelObjectType
      weave
      update classfile held in result
    end
  end
}

weaveClass(resultsPendingWeave) {
  foreach resultPendingWeave
    foreach classfile
      get corresponding BcelObjectType
      weave
      update classfile held in result
    end
  end
}


Note on createWorldAndWeaver(classpath)
 - we can probably avoid having to turn the Eclipse nameEnvironment
 into an externalized classpath by extending
 weaver.bcel.ClasspathManager to cope with "third party" managed
 classpath entries. On the eclipse side we can implement some
 interface and map it back into a call to INameEnvironment.findType -
 will need to cast returned IBinaryType into ClassFileReader, this is
 the only nasty. Much better than doing classpath nonsense though.

Note on handling the outjar option:
 - this will be addressed by the requestor, if they want the results
 to go into an outjar, they can do so when accepting results. It will
 also have to be known by the piece of logic that moves resources (but
 that is outside of compile anyway).

Note on handling sourceDirs:
 - this is a command-line option only, and is handled by adding all
 the source files in the directories to the list of sourceUnits passed
 into compile.

Note on handling aspectpath:
 - this is a list of directories and jar files containing class files
 to be added to the list of aspects. These class files will be added
 to the weaver's list of added aspects at the start of the weave phase

Note on handling injars, inpath: 
 - these contain a set of class files that were not generated via
 parsing source, but instead are read directly from disk. We build a
 dummy CompilationResult in which getClassFiles() returns ClassFile
 objects for each of the class files. (Note, may need to define a
 ClassFile subclass with that just takes byte[] - this is a horrid
 hack but contained, and keeps the rest of the design clean).  
 
Note on handling -XnoWeave:
 - just skip the weave phase!


Handling Batch Compiles From Eclipse Using the New Model
========================================================

Eclipse is responsible for building the name enviroment and list of
ICompilationUnits to be compiled (does this already today). Eclipse is
also responsible for creating and passing in the desired requestor
(does this already today too).

We will add a new BcelWorld constructor that takes an
org.aspectj.weaver.IManagedClasspath or similar in place of a
List of String classpath entries. ClasspathManager will be extended to
do the right thing with this, and on the Eclipse side we will
implement the interface backed by an INameEnvironment as discussed in
the notes above.

The AspectJ specific options (aspectpath etc) are stored in an
extension of IJavaProject, IAspectJProject, and persisted in .ajpath
(analagous to .classpath) in the AspectJ project.

The AbstractImageBuilder handles resource copying, and we don't need
to change this logic in any way.

That's all folks!

Handling Batch Compiles From ajc Using the New Model
====================================================

AjBuildManager creates the list of ICompilationUnits to be compiled in
the same way that it does today. 

It could obtain a classpath to give to the weaver from AjBuildConfig
in the same way that it does today - but it might be simpler and more
consistent to pass across an IManagedClasspath built from the
FileSystem (INameEnvironment) built from the classpath - this will
give consistency across inside and outside Eclipse compiles.

The compiler is constructed with a requestor that writes class files
in CompilationUnitResults out to disk at the output location (or jar
file) in the AjBuildConfig.

The AspectJ specific options (aspectpath etc) are obtained from
AjBuildConfig as today.

Resource copying will ideally be handled outside of the weaver (from
source dirs and inpath dirs only) inside AjBuildManager.

How Incremental Compilation Works in the JDT
============================================

Incremental compilation begins in the JavaBuilder with a request to
perform an incremental build. If the classpath of the project has
changed, or a binary project member (jar or .class file) has changed,
it reverts to a full build.

An IncrementalImageBuilder is then created and asked to build the
deltas since the last build. If this succeeds the new build state is
recorded for the next compile, otherwise we revert to a full build.

The IncrementalImageBuilder algorithm proceeds as follows:
   // initialize builder
   // walk this project's deltas, find changed source files
   // walk prereq projects' deltas, find changed class files & add 
      affected source files
   //   use the build state # to skip the deltas for certain prereq projects
   //   ignore changed zip/jar files since they caused a full build
   // compile the source files & acceptResult()
   // compare the produced class files against the existing ones on disk
   // recompile all dependent source files of any type with structural
      changes or new/removed secondary type
   // keep a loop counter to abort & perform a full build (after 5 attempts)



How Incremental Compilation Works in AspectJ 1.1.x
==================================================

As per batch building, except that:

* if previous built state (AjState) exists, we do not create a new
  bcelWorld (will use existing one). 
* create list of source files to compile by looking at all source
  files modified since last build date
* delete any class files that resulted from now deleted files, tell
  the weaver about them
* extend list of source files to compile with files containing types
  that reference types defined in modified source files
* ask the compiler to compile the source files
* find the list of source files that refer to things we changed, if
  its non-empty, defer to a batch build (this is like the eclipse
  algorithm, but with a loop count of 1).

now hand-off to weaver...

* tell the weaver about every class file we wrote
* weaver determines whether or not it needs to reweave everything by
  looking at added and deleted classes and searching for aspects
  (slight simplification)
* weave proceeds as before, weaving either only the added classes, or
  everything, as required.

How we want Incremental Compilation to proceed in AspectJ 1.2
=============================================================

This is harder to get right than batch (surprise). We still want the
same two statements to hold at the end of the compilation of an
individual source file:
1) all the class files have been written out and are ready to be used
2) all errors in any type defined in the file have been reported

In both cases, the real 'incremental' logic is outside of the Compiler
itself (in IncrementalImageBuilder and in AjBuildManager). In the
current ajc case though, all compilation iterations have completed
before entering a single back-end weave phase. Pushing weaving inside
compile (as outlined in the proposal for batch building) makes this
design harder to accomplish in the new world. We are saved by the fact
that the current AspectJ incremental implementation currently only
supports one go round the loop before bailing out to a full build, and
we can mimic that behaviour easily. 

The logic in AjState that currently updates the weaver with
addedClassFiles as compilation results are produced will have to be
moved into the compiler (adaptor), to occur between the intermediate
class file generation and the weaving phase.

Incremental AspectJ Compilation in Eclipse
==========================================

The JavaBuilder (one per project) will be responsible for managing the
bcelWorld and bcelWeaver. These will be passed to the Compiler
(Adaptor) prior to calling compile. The incremental build manager
which processes deltas will be responsible for informing the weaver of
deleted class files. Added class files are determined as compilation
progresses. Weaving will happen inside the compile method, as
described for batch, with the twist that the whole world may be
rewoven if the weaver feels this is necessary. To keep things
initially as close to the current AspectJ implementation as possible,
we will set the maximum loop limit to 1 in the IncrementalImageBuilder
so that we bail out to a full build if we don't compile everything we
need in the first go. With a suitable test suite in place, there's no
conceptual reason why we couldn't put that back up to 5 (the JDT
default) as far as I can see right now.
 When performing a whole world weave, the compiler may end up asking
requestors to acceptResult()s that they didn't request to be compiled,
but this is no different to the dependency analysis done on
referencing types that may then get added into subsequent incremental
loops in the JDT today.

Incremental AspectJ Compilation in ajc
======================================

AjBuildManager manages the bcelWorld and weaver as it does today, and
passes them to the compiler adaptor for it to call the weave method
rather than AjBuildManager calling weave directly as it does
today. 


Note on handling aspectpath:
If the JavaBuilder detects that the aspectpath itself has changed in
any way, it will request a full build. If delta analysis during the
first phase of incremental compilation detects that a jar or class
file in an aspectpath has changed, it will bail out to a full build.

Note on handling injars, inpath:
We must make sure that the delta analysis allows a project with only
an inpath change to proceed to building (rather than thinking that
there is nothing to do). Any changed jars or class files will have
their classes added to the weaver, and the weaver will be notified of
deletions too. We need to ensure that we still continue on to
compilation even when there are no "source files" in the work queue -
will need some design. 

For tomorrow:  start looking at refactoring AspectJ codebase itself to
fit the new shape, ahead of trying to do ImageBuilder integration at
the same time (in AspectJ, I have the test harness to guide me).
