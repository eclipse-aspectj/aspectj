<p>The installer cannot find the path to your Java home (J2SE 1.4 or greater).  
Please try to find this directory on your path now.  It will probably look
something like <code>jdk1.4.1</code>.  If you can't find this
directory now, you may continue with the install, but you will have
to either edit your launch scripts by hand or to set the JAVA_HOME
environment variable to point to the right location.
