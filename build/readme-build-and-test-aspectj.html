<h1>Build and Test AspectJ</h1>

This describes how to build and test AspectJ
for developers working on source code for AspectJ.
It covers building with Ant or Eclipse and testing with
JUnit and the harness used for compiler tests.

For information on how the build works and how to
debug failed builds, see

<h3>Quick start</h3>
This is a minimal introduction to building and testing AspectJ.

<p/>Command-line users use CVS to check out something like this:
<pre>
  export CVS_ROOT=":pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/home/technology"
  cvs co org.aspectj/modules</pre>
If using Eclipse, check out the subdirectories of
<code>org.aspectj/modules</code> as Eclipse projects.
Skip the  <code>aspectj-attic</code> module.

<p/>Build an AspectJ distribution:
<pre>
  cd org.aspectj/modules/build
  ../lib/ant/bin/ant</pre>

Install the distribution (e.g., into build/../aspectj-install):

<pre>  java -jar ../aj-build/dist/aspectj-DEVELOPMENT.jar</pre>

You can skip the GUI by specifying an existing, empty writable
target directory using <code>-to {targDir}</code>:

<pre>  java -jar ../aj-build/dist/aspectj-DEVELOPMENT.jar -to .</pre>

Test it by running the build script in the examples directory:

<pre>  cd ../aspectj-install/doc/examples
  ../../lib/ant/bin/ant</pre>

This should build and run the spacewar example.

<h3>Required sources, libraries, and tools</h3>
	<p>

To build requires only the AspectJ project modules and Java VM's.
All necessary libraries and tools are in the
<a href="../lib/">lib</a> directory, including Ant.
	</p>
<p>To get the source, check out from CVS.  E.g., from the command line,
</p>

<pre>
   export CVS_ROOT=":pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/home/technology"
   cvs co org.aspectj/modules
</pre>
<p>
	Eclipse users should check out each relevant subdirectory of
 <code>org.aspectj/modules</code> as a project
	(most have .project files).
</p>
<p>
Not all modules are required.
The <code>aspectj-attic</code> module only has old code.
</p>

<h3>Standard builds</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
The build system is designed to work standalone and support
Eclipse and Ant.
Each module is an Eclipse project, and all required libraries
are in lib/.
All build dependencies are read from Eclipse .classpath files
and managed using an Ant builder task,
so no Ant build scripts need to change when dependencies change.
However, that means the modules (read: Eclipse projects) can only
do what the builder task understands.  Currently it expects
release source files in <code>src</code> (or <code>java5-src</code>
for Java 5 code) and test source files in
<code>testsrc</code> (or <code>java5-testsrc</code>),
and can handle Java and AspectJ projects.
For more information on the build infrastructure and setup, see
<a href="readme-build-module.html">readme-build-module.html</a>
and <a href="#antInvariants">below</a>.

<h4>Building using Ant</h4>
<p>
You should use the Ant in ../lib/ant.  Currently this is a vanilla
distribution of Ant 1.6.3, but that might change.
</p>
<p>
This <a href=".">build</a> directory has a master
<a href="build.xml">build.xml</a> script, and the modules have
satellite <code>build.xml</code> which support building only that
module.
The <a href="release">release</a> directory has scripts for doing
release builds (in multiple VM's, with testing).  These are run by
automated build and before any AspectJ distribution.
Custom <code>build.xml</code> files are in
The <a href="../docs/build.xml">../docs/build.xml</a>,
	<a href="../org.aspectj.lib/build-aspectjlib.xml">org.aspectj.lib/build-aspectjlib.xml</a>,
and <a href="../eclipse.plugin/build.xml">../eclipse.plugin/build.xml</a>.
These are invoked by the master
<a href="build.xml">build.xml</a> as needed.
Other modules have generic <code>build.xml</code>'s that just
use the master build file to run targets <code>compile</code> and
<code>test</code> for that module.
(If you do <code>clean</code>, all binaries for all
modules are cleaned.)
</p>
<p>
The master <a href="build.xml">build.xml</a>
creates an AspectJ distribution in
	<a href="../aj-build/dist/aspectj-DEVELOPMENT.jar">
		../aj-build/dist/aspectj-DEVELOPMENT.jar
	</a>;
You'll notice module jar results are put in
	<a href="../aj-build/jars">../aj-build/jars</a>,
including <code>{module}.jar</code> and <code>{module}-test.jar</code>
(for the release and test classes) and
<code>{module}-all.jar</code>, and
<code>{module}-test-all.jar</code>
(including all antecedant classes and libraries).
See <a href="build.xml">build.xml</a> for other targets.
</p>
<p>
For any build, you should create your own version of
	<a href="local.properties">local.properties</a>, using
	<a href="sample.local.properties">sample.local.properties</a>
as a template.
When using the master <code>build.xml</code>,
consider defining "build.config" to pass flags to the Ant
builder.  E.g., to reuse Eclipse classes and log verbosely,
<p/>
<pre>
	ant -Dbuild.config=useEclipseCompiles,verbose
</pre>
<p>
(<code>useEclipseCompiles</code> is incompatible with release builds
since it mixes testing and release classes.)
<p/>
<h4>Example builds</h4>
<p>
For example, to build everything into a release bundle,
with verbose logging:
</p>
<pre>
  cd modules/build
  ../lib/ant/bin/ant
</pre>

<p>
To build only the asm module (and any modules it requires) using
<code>modules/build</code>:
</p>
<pre>
  cd modules/build
  ../lib/ant/bin/ant -f build.xml any-module -Dmodule.name=asm
</pre>
<p>
To build and test the asm module from that module:
</p>
<pre>
  cd modules/asm
  ../lib/ant/bin/ant test
</pre>

<p>
To build the test harness into
  <code>../aj-build/jars/testing-drivers-all.jar</code>:
</p>
<pre>
  cd modules/build
  ../lib/ant/bin/ant build-harness-jar
</pre>

<h4>Building with Eclipse</h4>
<p>
As mentioned above, the modules are Eclipse projects, so
once checked out, they should build as-is.
(You will need to be using a version of Eclipse that can
handle the .project and .classpath files in the modules/projects.)
That will enable you
to run the compiler or test harness from within Eclipse (see below),
but it will not build the AspectJ release as Ant does.
If you are making changes in Eclipse, you should set your default JRE
to the minimum supported by the AspectJ tools (currently JDK 1.3)
to avoid using later API's.
You'll need to set some variables in your Eclipse environment;
currently these are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><u>JAVA_HOME</u>: used to access <code>JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar</code>
		</li>
	<li><u>JRE15_LIB</u>: used to access Java 5 libraries.
		Some modules/projects use Java 5 API's.  These have
		per-project compiler settings for 5.0 compliance, but cannot
		be built with the default pre-1.5 VM libraries.
		Until the minimum VM required by the tools is 1.5,
		we'll need to define this variable.
		</li>
</ul>

<h4>Running the Ant build scripts from Eclipse</h4>
When running Ant from older versions of Eclipse,
be sure to replace the Eclipse Ant
libraries with ours.  In the Ant configuration, remove all jars
specified by Eclipse and add all the libraries in
<a href="../lib/ant/lib">../lib/ant/lib</a>
as well as in <a href="../lib/junit">../lib/junit</a>.
(Do not add <code>../lib/build/build.jar</code>, which is
added via a taskdef declaration.)
<p/>
If you find on rebuilding that the build products are not
being regenerated, you may need to manually delete them
or restart eclipse (the files are not being closed); see
<a href="readme-build-module.html">readme-build-module.html</a>
for more information.

<h4>Using Eclipse to compile but Ant to assemble</h4>
As mentioned above,
assuming Eclipse is compiling the AspectJ modules successfully,
you can use Ant to assemble the Eclipse-built .class files into a
product by including <code>useEclipseCompiles</code> in the
<code>build.config</code>.  That reduces the build process
to product assembly.
(And of course you can run Ant from Eclipse as described above.)

<h4>Running the compiler, browser, or harness from the command-line</h4>
The build produces jar files in
  <a href="../aj-build/jars/">../aj-build/jars/</a>,
some of which have manifests specifying the main class, so they
can be run using <code>java -jar {file} {arguments}</code>.

<p/>To run the compiler from the command-line, use the <code>ajbrowser</code> jar file:
<pre>
   java -jar aj-build/jars/ajbrowser-all.jar {compile arguments}
</pre>
This will run <code>ajbrowser</code> if you provide no arguments or
 only (unflagged) .lst file arguments.  To run the test harness,
 use the <code>testing-drivers</code> jar file:
<pre>
   java -jar aj-build/jars/testing-drivers-all.jar tests/ajcTests.xml ...
</pre>

<h4>Running the compiler, browser, or harness from Eclipse</h4>
To run things within Eclipse, create a run configuration from the
defining module using the main class:
<p/>

<table border="1" cellpadding="1">
<tr><th>Program</th><th>Module</th><th>Main</th></tr>
<tr><td>AspectJ compiler</td><td>org.aspectj.ajdt.core</td><td>org.aspectj.tools.ajc.Main</td></tr>
<tr><td>AspectJ browser</td><td>ajbrowser</td><td>org.aspectj.tools.ajbrowser.Main</td></tr>
<tr><td>Test harness</td><td>testing-drivers</td><td>org.aspectj.testing.drivers.Harness</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Running Ant-built jars from Eclipse</h4>
You can run build products (built jars) from Eclipse in two ways:
<ul>
   <li>Put them on the classpath of some run configuration</li>
   <li>Select the jar files and right-click to "open with default editor"
       (assuming your system is configured to run .jar files)</li>
</ul>
You might do this to run the installer or test the browser as built.
However, doing so might prevent those jar files from being recreated
in the next build.
It appears that sometimes these jar files are not close during the
Eclipse session, which means they cannot be overwritten in new builds,
even those run from a different Ant process.
If you find that builds are silently failing, try deleting the
build products.


<h3>Testing AspectJ</h3>
<p>
Each module has a tree of JUnit tests in the <code>testsrc</code> directory.
These parallel the <code>src</code> directories and contain roll-up suites
for each package
  (<code>{module}/testsrc/{packagePath}/{package}Tests.java</code>) and
for the module as a whole
  (<code>{module}/testsrc/{module}ModuleTests.java</code>).
</p>
<p>
The AspectJ project also has <i>additional</i> custom tests in the
<a href="../tests">tests module</a>,
mainly the compiler tests run by the harness in
  <a href="../tests/ajcTests.xml">ajcTests.xml</a>. <u>It is important
to run these additional compiler tests (not covered by the JUnit
suite) before and after any change to the compiler.</u>
</p>
<p>
The module <a href="../run-all-junit-tests">run-all-junit-tests</a>
refers to all the other modules and the compiler tests adapted through
the <a href="../tests/src">../tests/src</a>.  So the easiest way to
run the JUnit and compiler tests is to run the top-level suite
<a href="../run-all-junit-tests/testsrc/RunTheseBeforeYouCommitTests.java">
	RunTheseBeforeYouCommitTests</a>.
</p>

<h4>Running JUnit tests in Eclipse</h4>
JUnit tests may be run under eclipse by selecting any JUnit source file
and creating a run configuration for it, including the roll-up
	root test
<a href="../run-all-junit-tests/testsrc/RunTheseBeforeYouCommitTests.java">
	RunTheseBeforeYouCommitTests</a>.

<h4>Running JUnit tests in Ant from the command line</h4>
To run the JUnit tests for any module, just go there and
<pre>../lib/ant/bin/ant tests</pre>.

<h4>Running JUnit tests from the command-line without Eclipse or Ant</h4>
<p>
To run JUnit directly, put JUnit and the {module}-test-all.jar file
on the classpath:
</p>
<pre>
	set cp="lib/junit/junit.jar;aj-build/jars/util-test-all.jar"
	java -classpath "$cp" junit.textui.TestRunner UtilModuleTests
</pre>
<p>
The assembled (<code>-all</code>) jar files include all antecedants,
except for those "skipped" (like Ant and JUnit).
(For more on skipped libraries, see
<a href="readme-build-module.html">readme-build-module.html</a>).
</p>

<h4>Using the test harness to run compiler tests</h4>
<p>

The <a href="build.xml">build.xml</a> <code>build-harness-jar</code>
target builds a single jar with
the AspectJ binaries and a test harness as the main class.
It reads test suite files like
   <a href="../tests/ajcTests.xml">../tests/ajcTests.xml</a>;
use the -help flag to see available options.
For more information, see
  <a href="../tests/readme-tests-module.html">
           ../tests/readme-tests-module.html</a>.

<h3><a name="releases"></a>Releases</h3>
<h4>Release builds</h4>
Committers do official release builds to create the distribution
released in binary form from the web site.

Release builds differ mainly in running
from a clean, up-to-date tree and with correct build version values
in <a href="local.properties">local.properties</a>, which
will update <code>org.aspectj.bridge.Version</code>.
Do not run using the <code>build.config</code> value
<code>useEclipseCompiles</code>,
because this will include testing classes in the release libraries.
See <a href="#version">Version synchronization</a> below
for more details on how the version is updated.

<h4>Release preconditions and testing</h4>
<p/>
Normally, we do releases only after fixing all high-priority
(P1 and P2) bugs in the bug database
  (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?product=AspectJ&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;priority=P1&amp;priority=P2">
All open AspectJ bugs with P1 and P2</a>).
For bug fixes, associated tests in
  <code>tests/ajcTestsFailing.xml</code> are fixed and moved to
  <code>tests/ajcTests.xml</code>.


<p/>Before a release, run the release tests as described in
  <a href="../tests/readme-release-tests.html">
           ../tests/readme-release-tests.html</a>
  (deprecated? using:
  <a href="../build/release-checklist.txt">
           ../build/release-checklist.txt</a>).


<h4>Release completion</h4>
When the release build is accepted,
tag the tree with the release version
so others can do diffs or create patches
based on the release code.  E.g., from the command line:
<pre>
   cd org.aspectj/
   cvs tag -R -c v1_1_0
</pre>
<p/>
Pushing the release out to the web involves manually updating
the web with the release files and documentation,
  verifying the downloads and pages,
  and sending any release notifications.
  Save the release installer, test results, and any notes
  about deferred bugs or tests in
  <code>org.aspectj/releases/aspectj-{version}/</code>.

<h3>New modules, Java 5, and Ant-only build problems</h3>
<p>
	To reiterate (and as described more fully in
	<a href="readme-build-module.html">readme-build-module.html</a>),
	the build system introspects on module and the .classpath file
	to determine how to build.  Further, it enforces stricter build
	invariants than the Eclipse projects do; when your code works
	in Eclipse but fails in the Ant, it's your responsibility to fix it
	by following the build invariants below.
</p>
<p>
<p>What to do when adding a new module (i.e., eclipse project):
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Setup like the other modules, following the invariants below, esp.
    <ol>
        <li>same directory level</li>
        <li>same naming conventions for source folders</li>
        <li>same use of known classpath variables/entries</li>
    </ol>
	</li>
	<li>Add module to those checked for copyright/license in
        <a href="testsrc/org/aspectj/build/BuildModuleTests.java">
            testsrc/org/aspectj/build/BuildModuleTests.java
        </a>
	</li>
    <li>Add module to module dependency tree as usual in Eclipse project properties</li>
    <li>If the module is to produce a jar visible in {AspectJ}/lib,
        then add a zero-length file of the correct name to
        <a href="products/tools/dist/lib">products/tools/dist/lib</a>
        and an alias to that file from the module name in
		<a href="src/org/aspectj/internal/tools/build/Builder.properties">
			Builder.properties</a>
    </li>
    <li>To make the JUnit tests visible to the Ant builder, include a
        top-level Ant suite titled {Module}ModuleTests.java
    </li>
    <li>Test the build in Eclipse/JUnit using
        <a href="testsrc/org/aspectj/internal/build/BuildModuleTest.java">
            testsrc/org/aspectj/internal/build/BuildModuleTest.java
        </a>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
	How the build system introspects, and the build invariants that
	are enforced by the Ant build:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A given module is identified by its directory name.
	</li>
	<li>Most modules are Eclipse Java projects; some are AspectJ projects.
		Eclipse is not required to build.
	</li>
	<li>The file <code>{module.name}/.classpath</code> is read to determine
		the source directories and required projects and libraries.
	</li>
	<li>Normal Java source files are in <code>src</code> and <code>testsrc</code>
		directories.
	</li>
	<li>Java 5 source files are in <code>java5-src</code> and <code>java5-testsrc</code>
		directories.
	</li>
	<li>Neither <code>testsrc</code> directory is used in production builds.
	</li>
	<li>
		This only requires what's in the
		<a href="../lib">../lib</a> directory and the usual Java VM's.
		That means modules can only depend on each other and the libraries
		in <a href="../lib">../lib</a>.
	</li>
	<li>Modules are built into jar files.  <code>{module.name}.jar</code>
		includes only the module classes, and <code>{module.name}-all.jar</code>
		includes the module classes plus any antecendant modules and any
		required libraries not skipped (see below).
	</li>
	<li>A file <code>{module.name}/{module.name}.mf.txt</code>, if available,
		will be used as the jar file manifest, after replacing certain
		variables in the <code>.mf.txt</code> file.
	</li>
	<li>All required libraries are included in the production jars, except
		for testing libraries and those "skipped" in
		<a href="src/org/aspectj/internal/tools/build/Builder.properties">
			Builder.properties</a>
		(Ant, JUnit, etc.).
	</li>
	<li>Test classes are excluded from the compile process for production builds.
		These result in the same jar files; there is no way to
		tell externally whether the test classes were stripped from a jar.
	</li>
	<li>ONLY resources specified as <code>resource.pattern</code> in
		<a href="src/org/aspectj/internal/tools/build/Builder.properties">
			Builder.properties</a>
		are included with assembled jars.
	</li>
	<li>No <code>testing-*</code> module is used in production builds,
		directly or indirectly.
	</li>
	<li>It is an error for any code to depend on any <code>testsrc</code> code,
		whether in the same or another module.
	</li>
	<li>AspectJ projects are built in Ant using
		<a href="../lib/aspectj">../lib/aspectj</a>.
	</li>
	<li>Java 5 code is not supported in AspectJ (yet).
	</li>
	<li>Java 5 code is built in Ant only if JAVA_HOME points to Java 5 (or later).
	</li>
	<li>No normal code can depend on any Java 5 code.
		The build system checks by building everything using the
		lowest VM supported by the tools.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>That means there are a number of legal Eclipse projects and code
	arrangements which are not valid AspectJ modules.
	When you add modules, libraries, or dependencies, you must build
	with Ant to verify these invariants are not broken.
</p>
<h3>Build problems</h3>
Some build problems and fixes encountered in the past:
<ul>
	<li>If the build works in Eclipse, but fails in Ant,
		do not assume the build scripts are broken.
		See <a href="#antInvariants">Invariants enforced only in Ant</a>.
	</li>
  <li>If your compiles fail because Ant cannot find <code>javac</code>,
      put the JDK bin directory on your PATH and/or define
      the JAVA_HOME environment variable.
      Ant requires the path to the <code>javac</code> executable
      when the <code>BuildModule</code> taskdef runs.  I think it either
      gets it from <code>$JAVA_HOME</code> or if the <code>bin</code>
      directory is on the <code>PATH</code>.
   </li>
   <li>If using an IBM JDK at version 1.4 or higher within Eclipse,
   then the default value of JRE_LIB will point to the jar file
   "core.jar." Unlike the Sun JDK, IBM does not package the full
   runtime into a single jar ("rt.jar"), but instead has multiple
   jar files. Since core.jar does not contain the graphics libraries,
   several of the AspectJ projects will fail to build as checked out
   of CVS - there are missing dependencies on AWT and swing. The
   solution is to add graphics.jar to the project classpaths... BUT
   if this is added as an ordinary (external jar), then the main
   ant build script will pick up the contents of graphics.jar and
   include it in the aspectj distribution (obvious clue, the size of
   the built aspectjtools.jar doubles to about 10MB). Instead, from the
   Java Build Path properties page of the project, select "Add Library"
   and add the JDK library. You now have to remove the JRE_LIB entry
   from the project or Eclipse complains about duplicate jar files
   in the path.
   </li>
   <li>More generally, if you find extra classes in the assembled jars,
	most likely you have added unexpected libraries to the build, e.g.,
	when adding libraries for the IBM JRE.
	To skip those, add them to the "skip.libraries" list in
	<a href="src/org/aspectj/internal/tools/build/Builder.properties">
		src/org/aspectj/internal/tools/build/Builder.properties</a>.
	These libraries will always be skipped for any module built this way;
	there is no way to include a library in one module but not another.
	For more information on the properties file, see
	<a href="readme-build-module.html">readme-build-module.html</a>.
   </li>
</ul>
