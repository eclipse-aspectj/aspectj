= AspectJ library module

This module primarily contains binary libraries from open-source projects, some of which are subject to licenses other
than the Eclipse Public License (EPL). Those not subject to EPL are not distributed in source or binary form with
AspectJ (except for Apache's BCEL), but are used in the development of AspectJ. This module also contains some bootstrap
libraries and test sources.

* ant: Ant 1.6.3 from http:jakarta.apache.org/ant. This is a normal binary distribution, junit.jar in the lib dir. Ant
  is available under the Apache Software License.
* aspectj: This is just our version to avoid bootstrapping Ant builds of modules built with AspectJ. Likely to be
  replaced with bootstrapping.
* bcel: The Bytecode Engineering Library from http:jakarta.apache.org/bcel, available under the Apache Software License.
* build: bootstrap libraries for the build process.
* commons: Commons 1.0 from https://commons.apache.org[apache.org]. This is used only by the testing module.
* junit: JUnit 3.7 test libraries, available from https://junit.org[junit.org] and under the CPL.
* regexp: Regular expressions from the retired https://jakarta.apache.org[Apache Jakarta] project. This is used only by
  the testing module.
* test: bootstrap libraries for the test process. These could be replaced with build products, to avoid the checked-in
  versions being out of date, but these build products change rarely (and almost never in binary-incompatible ways).
