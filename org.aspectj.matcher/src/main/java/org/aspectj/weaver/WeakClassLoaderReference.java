import java.lang.ref.WeakReference;

/**
 * Wraps a reference to a classloader inside a WeakReference. This should be used where we do not want the existence of a
 * classloader reference to prevent garbage collection of that classloader (and possibly an associated weaver instance in the case
 * of load time weaving).
 * <p>
 * In more detail:<br>
 * When load time weaving, the class Aj maintains a WeakHashMap from the classloader instance to a weaver instance. The aim is that
 * the weaver is around as long as the classloader is and should the classloader be dereferenced then the weaver can also be garbage
 * collected. The problem is that if there are many references to the classloader from within the weaver, these are considered hard
 * references and cause the classloader to be long lived - even if the user of the classloader has dereferenced it in their code.
 * The solution is that the weaver should use instances of WeakClassLoaderReference objects - so that when the users hard reference
 * to the classloader goes, nothing in the weaver will cause it to hang around. There is a big assertion here that the
 * WeakClassLoaderReference instances will not 'lose' their ClassLoader references until the top level ClassLoader reference is
 * null'd. This means there is no need to check for the null case on get() in this WeakReference logic below, because we shouldn't
 * be using this weaver if its associated ClassLoader has been collected. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=210470
