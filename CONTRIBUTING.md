# Contributing to AspectJ

AspectJ is a maven project, as such it should import cleanly into your IDE. The project uses github for issue tracking ( https://github.com/eclipse/org.aspectj/issues ).

## Working on the codebase

### Importing the project

#### Eclipse

Simply run the maven project importer and point it at the root of the cloned AspectJ repository. This will import all of the AspectJ
modules.

Each module comes with its own test suite, however there is a module called `run-all-junit-tests` - within there is a 
file `RunTheseBeforeYouCommitTests` which you can launch as a JUnit test (rightclick -> RunAs -> Junit Test).
This will run a few thousand tests to verify your IDE import.

Some tests are conditional based on the JDK you are using in your IDE since they are exercising features only available in recent Java.
In order to execute all possible tests ensure you are running the tests with the latest available Java JDK release.
A JRE will likely not suffice because tools like javadoc will be invoked from the tests.

#### IntelliJ

Create a new project on the welcome screen with the `Get from VCS` button or within the IDE from `File | New | 
Project from version controlâ€¦` IntelliJ will recognize AspectJ as a multi-module maven project and import it as such.
To build, create a run/debug configuration with the command line set to `clean install` and other settings as 
appropriate. If you have multiple JDKs installed, on the `Runner` tab select the desired JDK for the build, set 
`JAVA_HOME` to match, and uncheck `Skip Tests`. Before running the build, select the profile matching your JDK in 
the maven pane (or put on the command line in your run/debug configuration with `-P`).


### Developing tests

If developing system tests based on the sources for complete Java applications, follow the pattern in the `tests` module.
For each version of AspectJ there is a `bugsNNN` folder with subfolders for each issue.
Then there is a pair consisting of a test specification in a `ajcNNN.xml` file in the `src/test/resources` folder and a `AjcNNNTests.java` source file in the `src/main/java` folder.
Simply follow the pattern for previous versions to add a new suite for a new version of AspectJ.
Alongside the `AjcNNNTests` file you might add other test suites for particular new language features of Java.
All these suites are then pulled together in a `AllTestsAspectJNNN.java` suite.
In turn the suites are pulled together in a `AllTestsNN` suite for the major version of AspectJ, and so on.

Creating a test is then this basic process:
- create a new folder based on the issue number in the correct `bugsNNN` folder.
Add the relevant material into that folder (.java sources, any resources, xml files, etc).
- Create a definition of the test steps ('build these files', 'package this jar from these classes') in the correct `ajcNNN.xml` file in the `src/main/resources` area.
- Created a test in the correct `AjcNNNTests.java` file that references the specification written in the XML.

### Compiler issues

AspectJ is based on a modified Eclipse JDT that is using a modified grammar, extended to support AspectJ constructs.
This modified compiler exists in a separate repository: https://github.com/eclipse/aspectj.eclipse.jdt.core

Some issues involving compiler problems, for example if Java code isn't working because a variable was named after an AspectJ keyword - these issues must be worked on in that other project, even though the tests for that will likely live in this project.
